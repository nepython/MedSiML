0	Ovarian cancer is the third most common gynaecological cancer worldwide, with an age-standardised incidence rate of 6.1 per 10,000 women. Standard therapy for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) includes a combination of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Cytoreductive surgery aims to remove as much of the visible tumour as possible. As extensive intraperitoneal metastases are typical of advanced EOC, cytoreductive surgery is usually an extensive procedure with the risk of excessive bleeding. Tranexamic acid given perioperatively is effective in reducing blood loss and allogeneic blood transfusion requirements in a variety of surgical settings. Therefore, tranexamic acid seems to be a promising agent for minimising blood loss and the need for blood transfusion among women with advanced EOC undergoing cytoreductive surgery.	Ovarian cancer is the third most common type of cancer affecting women worldwide. The standard treatment for advanced ovarian cancer involves surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, followed by chemotherapy. Since advanced ovarian cancer often spreads throughout the abdominal cavity, the surgery is usually extensive and carries a risk of significant bleeding. Tranexamic acid is a drug that helps reduce blood loss during surgery. Because it has been proven effective in reducing blood loss in various surgical settings, tranexamic acid appears to be a promising option for minimizing blood loss and the need for blood transfusions in women undergoing surgery for advanced ovarian cancer.

1	No studies compared liberal versus conservative fluid therapy in adults. Low- to high-quality evidence indicates that liberal fluid therapy might increase mortality among children with sepsis or septic shock in hospital and at four-week follow-up. It is uncertain whether there are any differences in adverse events between liberal and conservative fluid therapy because the evidence is of low quality. Trials including adults, patients in other settings, and patients with a broader spectrum of pathogens are needed. Once published and assessed, three ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of this review.	There were no studies comparing giving lots of fluids to giving less fluids in adults with sepsis or septic shock.  However, studies in children show that giving lots of fluids might make them more likely to die in the hospital and even a month later. It's unclear if giving lots of fluids causes more side effects, as the evidence isn't very strong.  More studies are needed, especially in adults and in different settings, including people with different infections.  Some ongoing studies may change our understanding of this topic once they are finished.	This review looked at whether giving fluids to children with sepsis or septic shock (septic shock) is better than giving fluids to people who don't have sepsis. The evidence suggests that giving fluids to children might increase the risk of death in the hospital and at four weeks of follow-up. It's unclear if there are any differences in side effects between giving fluids to children with sepsis and giving fluids to people who don't have sepsis because the evidence isn't very strong. We need more studies that include adults, people in other settings, and people with a wider range of germs. Once the results are published, three ongoing studies could change the conclusions of this review.
2	In children with urinary tract infection (UTI), only those with pyelonephritis (and not cystitis) are at risk for developing long-term renal sequelae. If non-invasive biomarkers could accurately differentiate children with cystitis from children with pyelonephritis, treatment and follow-up could potentially be individualized. The objectives of this review were to 1) determine whether procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can replace the acute DMSA scan in the diagnostic evaluation of children with UTI; 2) assess the influence of patient and study characteristics on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests, and 3) compare the performance of the three tests to each other. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, DARE, Web of Science, and BIOSIS Previews for this review. The reference lists of all included articles and relevant systematic reviews were searched to identify additional studies not found through the electronic search. We only considered published studies that evaluated the results of an index test (procalcitonin, CRP, ESR) against the results of an acute-phase DMSA scan (conducted within 30 days of the UTI) in children aged 0 to 18 years with a culture-confirmed episode of UTI. The following cutoff values were used for the primary analysis: 0.5 ng/mL for procalcitonin, 20 mg/L for CRP and 30 mm/h for ESR. Two authors independently applied the selection criteria to all citations and independently abstracted data. We used the bivariate model to calculate pooled random-effects pooled sensitivity and specificity values. A total of 24 studies met our inclusion criteria. Seventeen studies provided data for the primary analysis: six studies (434 children) included data on procalcitonin, 13 studies (1638 children) included data on CRP, and six studies (1737 children) included data on ESR (some studies had data on more than one test). The summary sensitivity estimates (95% CI) for the procalcitonin, CRP, ESR tests at the aforementioned cutoffs were 0.86 (0.72 to 0.93), 0.94 (0.85 to 0.97), and 0.87 (0.77 to 0.93), respectively. The summary specificity values for procalcitonin, CRP, and ESR tests at these cutoffs were 0.74 (0.55 to 0.87), 0.39 (0.23 to 0.58), and 0.48 (0.33 to 0.64), respectively. The ESR test does not appear to be sufficiently accurate to be helpful in differentiating children with cystitis from children with pyelonephritis. A low CRP value (< 20 mg/L) appears to be somewhat useful in ruling out pyelonephritis (decreasing the probability of pyelonephritis to < 20%), but unexplained heterogeneity in the data prevents us from making recommendations at this time. The procalcitonin test seems better suited for ruling in pyelonephritis, but the limited number of studies and the marked heterogeneity between studies prevents us from reaching definitive conclusions. Thus, at present, we do not find any compelling evidence to recommend the routine use of any of these tests in clinical practice.	Kids with urinary tract infections (UTIs) can have different types: cystitis and pyelonephritis. Only pyelonephritis can lead to long-term kidney problems. Doctors want to figure out if there are simpler tests like procalcitonin, CRP, or ESR that can tell if a kid has pyelonephritis instead of doing a DMSA scan, which is more invasive. This review looked at studies that compared these simpler tests to the DMSA scan in kids with UTIs.  The review found that ESR might not be accurate enough, CRP could be useful for ruling out pyelonephritis, and procalcitonin might be better for figuring out if a kid has pyelonephritis. However, there werenâ€™t enough studies or the results were too varied to be sure. So, currently, there's no strong evidence to suggest using these simpler tests routinely for all kids with UTIs.	This study looked at whether a test called procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) could accurately tell if a child has a urinary tract infection (UTI) compared to a scan done within 30 days of the UTI. The researchers wanted to see if these tests could accurately distinguish children with cystitis from children with pyelonephritis. They also wanted to see if the characteristics of the child and the study affected the accuracy of these tests. They found that procalcitonin, CRP, and ESR could be compared to a scan done within 30 days of the UTI in children with pyelonephritis. They also found that procalcitonin, CRP, and ESR could be used instead of a scan done within 30 days of the UTI.
3	We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) (to 14 February 2014). This register contains relevant reports of randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (all years); EMBASE (1974 to date); MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We identified unpublished trials by searching the National Institute of Health (NIH) Reporter, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials database (mRCT) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to December 2013). We scanned the reference lists of articles for additional studies. We placed no constraints on language and setting.	We looked for studies that tested different treatments for PTSD in a controlled way (randomized controlled trials).  We searched several large databases of medical research, including CENTRAL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO, for studies published up to February 14, 2014. We also looked for unpublished studies in the National Institute of Health (NIH) Reporter, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials database (mRCT), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (up to December 2013). We checked the lists of references in articles for additional studies. We didn't limit our search by language or location.

4	Two review authors independently assessed records, selected included studies, extracted data using a paper pro forma, and evaluated the risk of bias. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by consulting a third review author. We performed meta-analyses using a random-effects model, for the comparison of BtA versus placebo, to estimate pooled effects and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We performed preplanned subgroup analyses according to BtA dose used, the BtA formulation used, and the use (or not) of guidance for BtA injections. The primary efficacy outcome was improvement in cervical dystonia-specific impairment. The primary safety outcome was the proportion of participants with any adverse event.	Researchers looked at studies comparing botulinum toxin type A (BtA) injections, which are used to treat a condition called cervical dystonia, to a placebo (a fake treatment). They reviewed the studies, checked how reliable they were, and combined the results to see if BtA injections actually worked.  They also looked at different doses of BtA, different types of BtA, and whether using a guidance tool during the injection made a difference.  The main thing they wanted to see was if BtA improved the specific problems caused by cervical dystonia. They also wanted to know how many people had side effects from the injections.	This study looked at whether a medicine called BtA could help people with cervical dystonia, a condition that affects the neck. They compared BtA to a placebo (a fake medicine). The study found that BtA was effective in improving cervical dystonia. It also found that BtA was safe and didn't cause any side effects.
5	Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) is an important cause of severe visual loss following blunt or penetrating head trauma. Following the initial insult optic nerve swelling within the optic nerve canal or compression by bone fragments are thought to result in secondary retinal ganglion cell loss. Optic nerve decompression with steroids or surgical interventions or both have therefore been advocated to improve visual prognosis in TON. To examine the effects and safety of surgical interventions in the management of TON. We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE, (January 1950 to May 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to May 2013), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to May 2013), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 28 May 2013. We also searched the reference lists of other reviews and book chapters on TON. We also contacted researchers in the field. We planned to include only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of TON in which any form of surgical intervention either on its own or in combination with steroids was compared to steroids alone or no treatment. Two authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts identified from the search strategy. No studies were found that met our inclusion criteria and therefore none were included for analysis. No studies were found that met our inclusion criteria. The current body of evidence consists mostly of small, retrospective case series. Given the wide range of surgical interventions used in TON it is very difficult to compare these studies, even qualitatively. However, there is a relatively high rate of spontaneous visual recovery and no evidence that surgical decompression of the optic nerve provides any additional benefit. On the other hand, surgery carries a definite risk of complications such as postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak and meningitis. The decision to proceed with surgery in TON therefore remains controversial and each case needs to be assessed on its own merits. Although there is an urgent need for an adequately powered, RCT of surgical intervention in TON, this will prove a difficult endeavour.	Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) is a serious eye condition that happens when the optic nerve, which carries signals from the eye to the brain, is damaged by a blow to the head. This damage can lead to permanent vision loss. One way doctors have tried to treat TON is by performing surgery to relieve pressure on the optic nerve. However, there are no well-designed studies to prove that surgery actually helps. In fact, most people with TON get better on their own without surgery, and surgery itself can cause complications like spinal fluid leaks and infections. So, whether to have surgery for TON is a complex decision that depends on the individual case. More research is needed to find out if surgery is truly beneficial for treating TON.	Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) is a serious eye condition that can cause severe vision loss after a head injury. It's caused by damage to the optic nerve, which is the nerve that connects the eye to the brain. This can lead to swelling in the optic nerve, which can lead to blindness. Doctors are trying to figure out if surgery, either alone or with steroids, can help people with TON. However, there isn't enough evidence to say for sure if surgery helps or if it's safe. We need more research to see if surgery is a good treatment for TON.
6	Pairs of authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. We expressed intervention effects as risk ratios or rate ratios. We combined the results of similar studies in a meta-analysis. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for each combination of intervention and outcome using the GRADE approach.	We looked at many studies to see if different types of interventions could help people. We grouped similar studies together and analyzed the results. We used a system called GRADE to rate how good the evidence was for each intervention.	This study looked at how different treatments affect people's health. They looked at how well the treatments worked and if there were any problems with how they were done. They then combined the results of similar studies to get a more complete picture. They used a system called GRADE to assess the overall quality of the evidence for each combination of treatments and outcomes.
7	The primary objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of PPV versus scleral buckling for the treatment of simple RRD (primary RRD of any extension with up to two clock hours large break(s) regardless of their anterior/posterior localisation) in people with (phakia) or without (aphakia) a natural lens in the eye, or with an artificial lens (pseudophakia). A secondary objective was to assess any data on economic and quality-of-life measures.	"This study wanted to see if a surgery called ""PPV"" is better than another surgery called ""scleral buckling"" for fixing a problem called ""retinal detachment"".  They looked at people who had different types of lenses in their eyes, and whether or not the detachment was big or small.  They also wanted to see how the surgeries affected the quality of life and the costs of treatment."	This review aimed to see if PPV versus scleral buckling were effective in treating simple RRD, which is a tear in the eye that can last up to two hours. The main goal was to see if PPV was better than scleral buckling for treating RRD in people with phakia or without phakia, or with an artificial lens (pseudophakia). We also wanted to see if PPV was better than scleral buckling for treating RRD in people with phakia or without aphakia. We also wanted to see if PPV was better than scleral buckling for treating RRD in people with phakia or without aphakia. We also wanted to see if PPV was better than scleral buckling for people with pseudophakia. We also wanted to see if PPV was better than scleral buckling for people with aphakia.

8	We remain uncertain about the efficacy of diclofenac compared to placebo, active comparators, or by different routes of administration, for postoperative pain management in children. This is largely due to authors not reporting on clinically important outcomes; unclear reporting of the trials; or poor trial conduct reducing our confidence in the results. We remain uncertain about diclofenac's safety compared to placebo or active comparators, except for the comparison of diclofenac with opioids: diclofenac probably results in less nausea and vomiting compared with opioids, but more bleeding events. For healthcare providers managing postoperative pain, diclofenac is a COX inhibitor option, along with other pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Healthcare providers should weigh the benefits and risks based on what is known of their respective pharmacological effects, rather than known efficacy. For surgical interventions in which bleeding or nausea and vomiting are a concern postoperatively, the risks of adverse events using opioids or diclofenac for managing pain should be considered.	We don't have a clear answer yet on how well diclofenac works for pain relief after surgery in children compared to placebo (a fake pill) or other pain relievers. This is mainly because studies haven't focused on the right things, haven't reported their findings clearly, or weren't conducted well enough to trust their results.  We're also not sure how safe diclofenac is compared to placebo or other pain relievers, except when compared to opioids. Diclofenac probably causes less nausea and vomiting than opioids, but it might lead to more bleeding.  Healthcare professionals can use diclofenac to treat pain after surgery, alongside other medications and methods. They need to consider the pros and cons of diclofenac based on its known effects, rather than how well it's been shown to work. If bleeding or nausea and vomiting are concerns after surgery, the risks of using opioids or diclofenac for pain management should be carefully considered.	We're not sure if diclofenac is better than a fake pill (placebo) or other pain medications for managing pain after surgery in children. This is mostly because the studies we looked at didn't report on important outcomes, the studies weren't clear, or the studies weren't done well. We're also not sure if diclofenac is safe compared to a fake pill (placebo) or other pain medications. Diclofenac might cause less nausea and vomiting compared to opioids, but it might cause more bleeding. For healthcare providers managing postoperative pain, diclofenac is a COX inhibitor option, along with other medications and non-medical approaches. Healthcare providers should weigh the benefits and risks based on what's known about their pharmacological effects, rather than what's known about their effectiveness. For surgical interventions where bleeding or nausea and vomiting are a concern, the risks of side effects from opioids or diclofenac should be considered.
9	We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (OVID, 1950 to June 2014), EMBASE (1966 to June 2014), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, 1982 to June 2014), Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (1956 to June 2014), CAM on PubMed (1966 to June 2014), Alt HealthWatch (1997 to June 2014), PsycINFO (1967 to June 2014), the China Biological Medicine Database (CBM-disc, 1979 to June 2014), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI Database, 1999 to June 2014).

10	Forty-nine studies with 2135 participants met the inclusion criteria. No study performed stretch for more than seven months. Just over half the studies (51%) were at low risk of selection bias; all studies were at risk of detection bias for self reported outcomes such as pain and at risk of performance bias due to difficulty of blinding the intervention. However, most studies were at low risk of detection bias for objective outcomes including range of motion, and the majority of studies were free from attrition and selective reporting biases. The effect of these biases were unlikely to be important, given that there was little benefit with treatment. There was high-quality evidence that stretch did not have clinically important short-term effects on joint mobility in people with neurological conditions (MD 2deg; 95% CI 0deg to 3deg; 26 studies with 699 participants) or non-neurological conditions (SMD 0.2, 95% CI 0 to 0.3, 19 studies with 925 participants). In people with neurological conditions, it was uncertain whether stretch had clinically important short-term effects on pain (SMD 0.2; 95% CI -0.1 to 0.5; 5 studies with 174 participants) or activity limitations (SMD 0.2; 95% CI -0.1 to 0.5; 8 studies with 247 participants). No trials examined the short-term effects of stretch on quality of life or participation restrictions in people with neurological conditions. Five studies involving 145 participants reported eight adverse events including skin breakdown, bruising, blisters and pain but it was not possible to statistically analyse these data. In people with non-neurological conditions, there was high-quality evidence that stretch did not have clinically important short-term effects on pain (SMD -0.2, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.1; 7 studies with 422 participants) and moderate-quality evidence that stretch did not have clinically important short-term effects on quality of life (SMD 0.3, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.7; 2 studies with 97 participants). The short-term effect of stretch on activity limitations (SMD 0.1; 95% CI -0.2 to 0.3; 5 studies with 356 participants) and participation restrictions were uncertain (SMD -0.2; 95% CI -0.6 to 0.1; 2 studies with 192 participants). Nine studies involving 635 participants reported 41 adverse events including numbness, pain, Raynauds' phenomenon, venous thrombosis, need for manipulation under anaesthesia, wound infections, haematoma, flexion deficits and swelling but it was not possible to statistically analyse these data.	This study looked at 49 different research projects involving 2135 people to see if stretching helped improve joint movement in people with and without nerve problems. The studies lasted no longer than seven months.  The researchers found that stretching didn't have a significant impact on improving joint movement in the short term, whether people had nerve problems or not.  While some studies showed a small improvement in pain and activity levels, the results were not strong enough to say for sure that stretching helped.  The study also looked at the possible side effects of stretching.  There were a few cases of skin issues, bruising, and pain, but there wasn't enough data to study these side effects properly.	This study looked at 49 different research papers on stretching for people with neurological conditions. The researchers wanted to see if stretching helped people with neurological conditions move their joints better in the short term. They found that stretching didn't seem to help people with neurological conditions move their joints better in the short term. They also found that stretching didn't seem to help people with non-neurological conditions move their joints better in the short term. They also found that stretching didn't seem to help people with non-neurological conditions move their joints better in the short term. However, they didn't find any studies that looked at side effects like skin breakdown, bruising, blisters, or pain. They also found that stretching didn't seem to help people with non-neurological conditions move their joints better in the short term.
11	This Cochrane Review collected and updated pair-wise data from two previous Cochrane Reviews. Searches were updated and additional studies included. We conducted three separate network meta-analyses (NMAs) within a Bayesian framework to assess three outcomes: exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events. For quality of life, we collected data from St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Using previously validated methods, we selected the simplest model that could adequately fit the data for every analysis. We used threshold analysis to indicate which results were robust to potential biases, taking into account each study's contributions to the overall results and network structure. Probability ranking was performed for each antibiotic class for exacerbations, quality of life, and serious adverse events.	This review combined information from two previous reviews on antibiotics used to treat COPD. We looked at three main things: how often people had flare-ups, how their quality of life was affected, and whether they had serious side effects.  We used a special method called network meta-analysis to analyze the data from different studies.  We also looked at how sensitive the results were to potential biases in the studies.  We ranked different types of antibiotics based on how well they worked for each of these outcomes.	This study looked at how well different types of antibiotics work for people with lung problems. They looked at data from two previous studies and added new ones. They used a special method called network meta-analyses (NMAs) to analyze the data. They looked at things like how many people had lung problems, how well their quality of life was, and if they had any serious side effects. For quality of life, they used a questionnaire called the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). They used a special method called threshold analysis to make sure the results were accurate. They also looked at how well each study was able to handle any potential biases. Finally, they ranked the results based on how many people had lung problems, how well their quality of life was, and if there were any serious side effects.
12	There is no evidence of a difference between oral DTIs and standard anticoagulation in the prevention of recurrent pulmonary embolism. Using the GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence was high. The evidence of the effectiveness of oral factor Xa inhibitors for the prevention of recurrent pulmonary embolism was too heterogenous to combine in a pooled analysis. For the outcomes recurrent venous thromboembolism, DVT, all-cause mortality and major bleeding there is no evidence of a difference between DOACs and standard anticoagulation. According to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence was moderate to high.	This study looked at whether taking oral blood thinners (DTIs) is better than standard blood thinners for preventing blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) from happening again.  The study found no difference between the two types of blood thinners. The quality of the evidence was very good. Another type of blood thinner called a factor Xa inhibitor was also studied. However, the results were too different to combine. When looking at other outcomes like blood clots in the legs (DVT), death from any cause, and major bleeding, there was no difference between the new blood thinners (DOACs) and standard blood thinners. The quality of the evidence for these outcomes was good to very good.	This study looked at the effectiveness of oral factor Xa inhibitors (DTIs) in preventing recurrent pulmonary embolism, a type of blood clot in the lungs. The study found no difference between oral DTIs and standard anticoagulation in preventing recurrent pulmonary embolism. The quality of the evidence was moderate to high. The evidence on oral factor Xa inhibitors for preventing recurrent pulmonary embolism was too diverse to combine them in a single analysis. For outcomes like recurrent venous thromboembolism, DVT, all-cause mortality, and major bleeding, there is no difference between oral DTIs and standard anticoagulation. The quality of the evidence was moderate to high.

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of measures implemented in schools to safely reopen or keep schools open during the COVID-19 pandemic.  It will focus on the types of measures used in schools and the outcomes, like how much the virus spread, how many people needed medical care, and other health, societal, economic, and environmental impacts.

14	The evidence from this systematic review is uncertain regarding the effect of therapeutic ultrasound on pain in individuals with chronic non-specific LBP. Whilst there is some evidence that therapeutic ultrasound may have a small effect on improving low back function in the short term compared to placebo, the certainty of evidence is very low. The true effect is likely to be substantially different. There are few high-quality randomised trials, and the available trials were very small. The current evidence does not support the use of therapeutic ultrasound in the management of chronic LBP.	We looked at a bunch of studies to see if using ultrasound on people with chronic lower back pain actually helps. We found that it might help a little bit in the short term, but the evidence is weak. Most of the studies were small and not very good quality. So, we don't recommend using ultrasound for chronic lower back pain.	This study looked at whether ultrasound scans can help people with chronic low back pain. The study found that ultrasound scans might have a small effect on improving low back function in the short term compared to a fake scan, but the evidence is very weak. The true effect is likely to be much different. There aren't many high-quality studies, and the studies we found were very small. The current evidence doesn't support using ultrasound scans to treat chronic low back pain.
15	Elevated levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein play an important role in the development of atheromas and, therefore, in cardiovascular diseases. Cholesterol biosynthesis follows a circadian rhythm and is principally produced at night (between 12:00 am and 6:00 am). The adjustment of hypolipaemic therapy to biologic rhythms is known as chronotherapy. Chronotherapy is based on the idea that medication can have different effects depending on the hour at which it is taken. Statins are one of the most widely used drugs for the prevention of cardiovascular events. In usual clinical practice, statins are administered once per day without specifying the time when they should be taken. It is unknown whether the timing of statin administration is important for clinical outcomes.	High levels of cholesterol and a type of cholesterol called LDL are bad for your heart. They can cause build-up in your arteries, which can lead to heart problems. Your body makes cholesterol throughout the day, but it makes the most between midnight and 6am. Doctors are trying to find out if giving cholesterol-lowering medicine at a certain time of day might be better for preventing heart problems. This type of treatment is called chronotherapy.	High levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) are important for developing atheromas and, therefore, heart disease. Cholesterol biosynthesis follows a circadian rhythm and is mostly produced at night (between 12:00 am and 6:00 am). The adjustment of hypolipaemic therapy to biologic rhythms is known as chronotherapy. Chronotherapy is based on the idea that medication can have different effects depending on the hour at which it is taken. Statins are one of the most commonly used drugs for preventing cardiovascular events. In usual practice, statins are given once per day without specifying the time when they should be taken. It is unclear whether the timing of statin administration is important for clinical outcomes.
16	Following completion of abstract and full-text screening, we used purposive sampling to select a sample of eligible studies that covered a range of pre-defined criteria, including rich data, range of countries and country income level, settings, participants, and types of partnership activities. A Framework Synthesis approach was used to synthesise the findings of the sample. We appraised the quality of each study using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skill Program) tool. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach. The Stakeholder Panel was involved in each stage of the review from development of the protocol to development of the best practice principles.	We wanted to find the best ways to help people work together to improve health. So, we looked at many different studies from around the world. We chose studies that included lots of information, came from different countries with different levels of wealth, and involved different types of people and partnerships. We used a special method called Framework Synthesis to combine all the findings. We also checked how good the studies were using a tool called CASP. Then, we rated how confident we were in the results using another tool called GRADE-CERQual. Experts in this field helped us every step of the way, from planning the project to developing the final guidelines.	"This study looked at how to improve healthcare for people in developing countries. The researchers reviewed many studies to see if they met certain criteria.

17	This is an updated Cochrane review, last published in 2014. For the latest update, we searched the following databases on 22 January 2019: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to January 21, 2019), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted the manufacturers of tiagabine and experts in the field to identify any ongoing or unpublished studies.	This is an updated review of research on tiagabine, which was last published in 2014. To find the latest information, we searched a number of medical databases on January 22nd, 2019. We looked at studies in all languages, and we also contacted the company that makes tiagabine and some experts in epilepsy to see if they knew about any studies that weren't published yet.	This is an updated review of studies on tiagabine, a treatment for epilepsy. It was last updated in 2014. To find the latest information, we searched several databases, including the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

18	We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions used to prevent post-transfer embryo expulsion in women undergoing IVF and ICSI. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and reviewed the full-texts of all potentially eligible citations to determine whether they met our inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.	We included studies that were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) looking at treatments used to prevent the embryo from being expelled after it's been transferred into the woman's womb during IVF or ICSI. Two researchers independently reviewed the titles and summaries of the studies and then read the full studies to see if they met our inclusion criteria. If they disagreed, they discussed it until they reached an agreement.	We included studies that looked at ways to prevent embryos from being expelled after embryo transfer in women undergoing IVF and ICSI. Two researchers independently reviewed the titles and summaries of the studies and looked at the full text of the studies to see if they met our criteria. If there were any disagreements, we resolved them by consensus.
19	Whilst the confidence intervals for the summary points of the different visual classification systems indicated reasonable performance, they do not reflect the confidence that one can have in the accuracy of assessment using these systems due to the considerable unexplained heterogeneity evident across the studies. The prediction regions in which the sensitivity and specificity of a future study should lie are very broad, an important consideration when interpreting the results of this review. Should treatment be provided as a consequence of a false-positive result then this would be non-invasive, typically the application of fluoride varnish where it was not required, with low potential for an adverse event but healthcare resource and finance costs. Despite the robust methodology applied in this comprehensive review, the results should be interpreted with some caution due to shortcomings in the design and execution of many of the included studies. Studies to determine the diagnostic accuracy of methods to detect and diagnose caries in situ are particularly challenging. Wherever possible future studies should be carried out in a clinical setting, to provide a realistic assessment of performance within the oral cavity with the challenges of plaque, tooth staining, and restorations, and consider methods to minimise bias arising from the use of imperfect reference standards in clinical studies.	This study looked at different ways to find cavities in teeth. While the methods seem to work fairly well, there's a lot of variation in how well they work across different studies. This means we need to be careful when interpreting the results. If we use these methods to find cavities and it turns out there's no cavity, the worst that could happen is we put on a protective fluoride coating that wasn't needed. However, we still need to consider the cost and resources involved. Overall, the study was well-done, but we need to be cautious because some of the studies it was based on weren't perfect. Future studies should be done in a real dental setting, where there's plaque, staining, and fillings, to get a more realistic idea of how well these methods work.	This study looked at different ways to diagnose cavities in the mouth. While the studies showed that these methods were good at identifying cavities, they weren't as good as they could be because the studies were very different from each other. We need to be careful about how we interpret the results because many of the studies were not very well designed. Future studies should be done in real-life situations to get a realistic picture of how well these methods work with plaque, tooth staining, and restorations.
20	Trigger finger is a disease of the tendons of the hand leading to triggering (locking) of affected fingers, dysfunction and pain. Available treatments include local injection with corticosteroids, surgery, or splinting. To summarize the evidence on the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections for trigger finger in adults using the following endpoints: treatment success, frequency of triggering or locking, functional status of the affected fingers, and severity of pain of the fingers. The databases CENTRAL, DARE, MEDLINE (1966 to November 2007), EMBASE (1956 to November 2007), CINAHL (1982 to November 2007), AMED (1985 to November 2007) and PEDro (a physiotherapy evidence database) were searched. We selected randomized and controlled clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections for trigger finger in adults. The databases were searched for titles of eligible studies. After screening abstracts of these studies, full text articles of studies which fulfilled the selection criteria were obtained. Data were extracted using a predefined electronic form. The methodological quality of included trials was assessed by using items from the checklist developed by Jadad and the Delphi list. We planned to extract data regarding information on the primary outcome measures: treatment success, frequency of triggering or locking, and functional impairment of fingers, severity of the trigger finger; and the secondary outcome measures: proportion of patients with side effects, types of side effects, and patient satisfaction with injection. Two randomized controlled studies were found that involved 63 participants: 34 were allocated to corticosteroids and lidocaine, and 29 were allocated to lidocaine alone. Corticosteroid injection with lidocaine was more effective than lidocaine alone on treatment success at four weeks (relative risk 3.15, 95% CI 1.34 to 7.40). The number needed to treat to benefit was 3. No adverse events or side effects were reported. The effectiveness of local corticosteroid injections was studied in only two small randomized controlled trials of poor methodological quality. Both studies showed better short-term effects of corticosteroid injection combined with lidocaine compared to lidocaine alone on the treatment success outcome. In one study the effects of corticosteroid injections lasted up to four months. No adverse effects were observed. The available evidence for the effectiveness of intra-tendon sheath corticosteroid injection for trigger finger can be graded as a silver level evidence for superiority of corticosteroid injections combined with lidocaine over injections with lidocaine alone.	Trigger finger is a condition that affects the tendons in your hand, causing your fingers to get stuck or lock. It can be painful. Some ways to treat it include injecting medicine called corticosteroids, surgery, or using a splint to keep your finger straight. We looked at studies that investigated whether injecting corticosteroids is a good way to treat trigger finger in adults. We found two studies that included 63 people. In these studies, injecting corticosteroids along with a numbing medicine (lidocaine) was more effective in treating trigger finger compared to just using the numbing medicine alone. However, these studies were small and had some limitations.  While there were no negative side effects reported, the results suggest that corticosteroid injections might be helpful for trigger finger in the short term.	Trigger finger is a condition that affects the tendons in your hand. It causes your fingers to lock together and cause pain. There are different treatments for trigger finger, including injections of corticosteroids, surgery, or splinting. We wanted to find out if injections of corticosteroids are effective and safe for trigger finger in adults. We looked at studies that compared injections of corticosteroids with lidocaine to lidocaine alone. We found that injections of corticosteroids with lidocaine were more effective in the short term, lasting up to four months. However, we need more research to be sure if injections are safe and effective for trigger finger.
21	Our search strategy used two concepts: (1) glioma and the various histologies of interest, and (2) MR perfusion. We used structured search strategies appropriate for each database searched, which included: MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), and Web of Science Core Collection (Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index). The most recent search for this review was run on 9 November 2016. We also identified'grey literature' from online records of conference proceedings from the American College of Radiology, European Society of Radiology, American Society of Neuroradiology and European Society of Neuroradiology in the last 20 years.	We searched for research articles about brain tumors called gliomas, and how they appear on MRI scans using a special technique called perfusion. We looked for these articles in three large databases: MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. We also found additional articles from conferences hosted by several radiology organizations over the past 20 years. The last time we searched for articles was November 9, 2016.	We looked for information about glioma, a type of brain tumor, and how it affects the brain. We used two main categories: (1) glioma and the different types of brain tumors we were interested in, and (2) MRI perfusion. We searched several databases, including MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), and Web of Science Core Collection (Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index). The most recent search for this review was done on November 9, 2016. We also found 'grey literature' from online conference proceedings from the American College of Radiology, European Society of Radiology, American Society of Neuroradiology, and European Society of Neuroradiology in the last 20 years.
22	Retained placenta is a potentially life-threatening condition because of its association with postpartum hemorrhage. Manual removal of placenta increases the likelihood of bacterial contamination in the uterine cavity. To compare the effectiveness and side-effects of routine antibiotic use for manual removal of placenta in vaginal birth in women who received antibiotic prophylaxis and those who did not and to identify the appropriate regimen of antibiotic prophylaxis for this procedure. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2014). All randomized controlled trials comparing antibiotic prophylaxis and placebo or non antibiotic use to prevent endometritis after manual removal of placenta in vaginal birth. There are no included trials. In future updates, if we identify eligible trials, two review authors will independently assess trial quality and extract data No studies that met the inclusion criteria were identified. There are no randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent endometritis after manual removal of placenta in vaginal birth.	When a placenta doesn't come out after a baby is born, it's called a retained placenta. This can be very dangerous because it can lead to heavy bleeding after childbirth. Sometimes, doctors need to manually remove the placenta, which can increase the risk of bacteria getting into the womb.  This study was looking at whether giving antibiotics before the procedure could help prevent infections in the womb after a manual placenta removal. However, we couldn't find any studies that had been done on this topic. So, we don't know if antibiotics are helpful in this situation. We'll keep looking for studies to see if we can answer this question.	This study aimed to find out if using antibiotics to prevent endometritis after removing placenta in vaginal birth is effective and safe. The researchers looked at studies that compared using antibiotics to prevent endometritis after removing placenta in vaginal birth to using a fake medicine (placebo) or not using antibiotics. They wanted to see if using antibiotics to prevent endometritis was better than not using antibiotics. They searched for studies that compared using antibiotics to using a fake medicine (placebo) or not using antibiotics to prevent endometritis after removing placenta in vaginal birth. They couldn't find any studies that met their criteria. More research is needed to figure out the best way to use antibiotics to prevent endometritis after removing placenta in vaginal birth.
23	Two review authors conducted study selection, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment independently. Using intention-to-treat analysis with random-effects models, we combined dichotomous data to obtain risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed heterogeneity using the Chi2 test (P < 0.10) and I2 statistic (> 50%). To explore sources of heterogeneity, we conducted a priori subgroup analyses according to trial design, publication type, risk of bias, use of precut sphincterotomy, inadvertent guidewire insertion or contrast injection of the pancreatic duct (PD), use of a PD stent, cannulation device, and trainee involvement in cannulation. To assess the robustness of our results, we carried out sensitivity analyses using different summary statistics (RR versus odds ratio (OR)) and meta-analytic models (fixed-effect versus random-effects) and per-protocol analysis.	Two experts carefully reviewed all the studies, making sure they were done correctly. We used a specific statistical method called intention-to-treat analysis to combine the results of the studies. We also checked how much the results varied between studies to see if there was any reason to doubt the overall conclusion. Finally, we checked the results again using different statistical methods to make sure our findings were accurate.	This study looked at the effects of a type of surgery called sphincterotomy on the pancreatic duct (PD). The researchers wanted to see if the surgery was safe and effective. They also looked at different types of surgery, such as precut sphincterotomy, inadvertent guidewire insertion or contrast injection of the pancreatic duct (PD), use of a PD stent, cannulation device, and trainee involvement in cannulation. To see if the results were reliable, they used different statistical methods like summary statistics (RR versus odds ratio (OR)), meta-analytic models (fixed-effect versus random-effects), and per-protocol analysis (per-protocol analysis).
24	We expected substantial heterogeneity across trials in terms of how extensive rehabilitation programmes were (i.e. in terms of number of completed exercise sessions; type, intensity and supervision of exercise training; and patient education), duration of follow-up (< 3 months vs >= 3 months) and risk of bias (generation of random sequence, concealment of random allocation and blinding); therefore, we performed subgroup analyses that were defined before we carried them out. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane in preparing this update, and we used GRADE for assessing the quality of evidence.	We expected big differences between the studies in terms of how extensive the rehabilitation programs were. This included things like the number of exercise sessions, the type, intensity, and supervision of exercise training, and patient education. We also expected differences in how long the follow-up was and in the risk of bias in the studies. Because of this, we did subgroup analyses, which we planned to do before we actually did them. We used standard methods from the Cochrane Collaboration in preparing this update, and we used the GRADE system to assess the quality of the evidence.	This study looked at different types of exercise programs to help people recover from injuries. They wanted to see if these programs were different depending on how long they lasted, how long they lasted, and how likely they were to be biased. They used standard methods to prepare this update, and they used a system called GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.
25	Randomised trials of additional social support during at-risk pregnancy by either a professional (social worker, midwife, or nurse) or specially trained lay person, compared to routine care. We defined additional social support as some form of emotional support (e.g. caring, empathy, trust), tangible/instrumental support (e.g. transportation to clinic appointments, home visits complemented with phone calls, help with household responsibilities) or informational support (advice and counselling about nutrition, rest, stress management, use of alcohol/recreational drugs).	This review focuses on studies that randomly assigned pregnant women at risk for having a premature baby or a baby with a low birthweight to either receive extra social support from a professional (like a social worker, midwife, or nurse) or a specially trained volunteer, or to receive standard care.  We defined extra social support as including some type of emotional support (like feeling cared for, empathy, and trust), tangible support (like transportation to appointments, home visits with phone calls, and help with housework), or informational support (advice and counseling about things like nutrition, rest, stress management, and alcohol or drug use).	This study looked at whether giving extra social support during a woman's pregnancy to a professional (like a social worker, midwife, or nurse) or a specially trained person was better than regular care. They found that extra social support can include emotional support (like caring, empathy, trust), tangible/instrumental support (like transportation to appointments, home visits with phone calls, help with household responsibilities), or informational support (like advice and counseling about nutrition, rest, stress management, alcohol/recreational drugs).
26	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle condition starting in childhood, leading to severe disability and a shortened life span. It is due to severe deficiency of the protein dystrophin which performs both structural and signalling roles within skeletal and cardiac myocytes. Calcium accumulates in dystrophic muscle cells and plays a role in cell damage. It has been hypothesised that use of calcium antagonists might reduce this calcium load and its toxic effect on muscle cells. This is an updated review, in which no new trials were found. To evaluate the effects of calcium antagonists on muscle function and muscle strength in people with DMD. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (July 2010), MEDLINE (from January 1950 to July 2010) and EMBASE (from January 1947 to July 2010). We also searched bibliographies in reports of any trials. All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of any calcium antagonist in people with DMD. Both authors assessed all identified trials for inclusion in the study on the basis of whether they fulfilled the selection criteria. Both authors extracted data from the trials and assessed the methodological quality. Had there been more than one trial of the same intervention and outcome of sufficient methodological quality, we had planned to undertake a meta-analysis. Five randomised or quasi-randomised double-blind trials fulfilled the selection criteria, but were not sufficiently comparable to undertake a meta-analysis. The drugs studied were verapamil (8 participants), diltiazem (56 participants), nifedipine (105 participants) and flunarizine (27 participants). There were limitations in the description of blinding and randomisation, and definition of outcome measures. One trial, using verapamil, showed a difference between groups in muscle force measured by ergometry, but also revealed cardiac side effects. The numbers of people included in the trials were low, and so the studies may not have included enough people for sufficient power to detect small differences in muscle force or function between placebo and control groups. In addition, calcium antagonists were in an early stage of development and some of the second generation drugs that have a better side effect profile, such as amlodipine, have not been studied. There is no evidence to show a significant beneficial effect of calcium antagonists on muscle function in DMD.	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a serious condition that weakens muscles, starting in childhood. It makes moving difficult and shortens life. DMD happens because of a missing protein called dystrophin, which helps muscles work. Calcium builds up in the weakened muscles and can damage them further. Scientists thought that medicines called calcium antagonists could help by reducing the calcium buildup.  They searched through medical studies to see if these medicines improved muscle strength in people with DMD. They found a few small studies that used different calcium antagonists, but the studies were not good enough to know for sure if these medicines helped. One study with a medicine called verapamil showed a small improvement in muscle strength, but it also caused problems with the heart.  Overall, there is no clear evidence that calcium antagonists are effective for DMD.	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a condition that affects the muscles in people with DMD. It starts in childhood and can lead to severe disability and a shorter life span. It's caused by a deficiency in a protein called dystrophin. Calcium builds up in these muscle cells and can damage them. Scientists have been trying to find ways to reduce the amount of calcium in these muscle cells. However, there wasn't enough evidence to say for sure if calcium antagonists help with muscle function or strength in people with DMD. They looked at five studies that tested different types of calcium antagonists, including verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine, and flunarizine. However, the studies weren't very well designed, so more research is needed.
27	Seventeen RCTs met our inclusion criteria providing 4763 adults and children from Africa, South-America, and South-East Asia. Eight trials reported PCR-adjusted data to distinguish between new and recrudescent infection during the follow-up period. In this abstract, we report only the comparisons against the three WHO-recommended antimalarials which were included within these trials. There were two comparisons with artemether-lumefantrine, one trial from 2008 in Ethiopia with 60 participants had two failures with atovaquone-proguanil compared to none with artemether-lumefantrine (PCR-adjusted treatment failures at day 28). A second trial from 2012 in Colombia with 208 participants had one failure in each arm (PCR-adjusted treatment failures at day 42). There was only one comparison with artesunate-amodiaquine from a 2014 trial conducted in Cameroon. There were six failures with atovaquone-proguanil at day 28 and two with artesunate-amodiaquine (PCR-adjusted treatment failures at day 28: 9.4% with atovaquone-proguanil compared to 2.9% with artesunate-amodiaquine; RR 3.19, 95% CI 0.67 to 15.22; 1 RCT, 132 participants; low-certainty evidence), although there was a similar number of PCR-unadjusted treatment failures (9 (14.1%) with atovaquone-proguanil and 8 (11.8%) with artesunate-amodiaquine; RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.91; 1 RCT, 132 participants; low-certainty evidence). There were two comparisons with artesunate-mefloquine from a 2012 trial in Colombia and a 2002 trial in Thailand where there are high levels of multi-resistant malaria. There were similar numbers of PCR-adjusted treatment failures between groups at day 42 (2.7% with atovaquone-proguanil compared to 2.4% with artesunate-mefloquine; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.34; 2 RCTs, 1168 participants; high-certainty evidence). There were also similar PCR-unadjusted treatment failures between groups (5.3% with atovaquone-proguanil compared to 6.6% with artesunate-mefloquine; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.3; 1 RCT, 1063 participants; low-certainty evidence). When atovaquone-proguanil was combined with artesunate, there were fewer treatment failures with and without PCR-adjustment at day 28 (PCR-adjusted treatment failures at day 28: 2.16% with atovaquone-proguanil compared to no failures with artesunate-atovaquone-proguanil; RR 5.14, 95% CI 0.61 to 43.52; 2 RCTs, 375 participants, low-certainty evidence) and day 42 (PCR-adjusted treatment failures at day 42: 3.82% with atovaquone-proguanil compared to 2.05% with artesunate-atovaquone-proguanil (RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.95 to 3.56; 2 RCTs, 1258 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). In the 2002 trial in Thailand, there were fewer treatment failures in the artesunate-atovaquone-proguanil group compared to the atovaquone-proguanil group at day 42 with PCR-adjustment. Whilst there were some small differences in which adverse events were more frequent in the atovaquone-proguanil groups compared to comparator drugs, there were no recurrent associations to suggest that atovaquone-proguanil is strongly associated with any specific adverse event.	This study looked at how well a malaria medicine called atovaquone-proguanil worked compared to other malaria medicines.  The study included 4763 adults and children from Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia.  The researchers found that atovaquone-proguanil worked about as well as other medicines, with a few exceptions. In one case, it was better when combined with another medicine called artesunate.  There were some side effects, but none that were particularly common or serious.	This study looked at 17 different trials involving 4763 adults and children from Africa, South-America, and South-East Asia. The trials compared different types of antimalarial medications, including artemether-lumefantrine, atovaquone-proguanil, artesunate-amodiaquine, and artesunate-mefloquine. The study found that atovaquone-proguanil was better than artemether-lumefantrine in preventing infections. The study also found that atovaquone-proguanil was better than artesunate-amodiaquine in preventing infections.
28	Betamimetic drugs may promote fetal growth by increasing the availability of nutrients and by decreasing vascular resistance. They may also induce adverse effects via their effects on carbohydrate metabolism. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of betamimetic therapy for suspected impaired fetal growth on fetal growth and perinatal outcome. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (June 2009). Randomized trials of betamimetic therapy compared with no betamimetic therapy or placebo in women with suspected impaired fetal growth. Eligibility and trial quality was assessed. Two studies of 118 women were included. No statistically significant differences were found between the betamimetic groups and the control groups for low birthweight (risk ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 0.75 to 1.83), other anthropometric measures or neonatal morbidity and mortality. Larger, well-designed studies are needed to evaluate the effects of betamimetics on fetal growth. Since there is potential for adverse effects due to the pharmacological characteristics of this group of drugs, data related to any potential harms should be collected in addition to beneficial effects.	This review looked at the use of betamimetic drugs for babies who are not growing as expected in the womb. These drugs can help babies grow by improving blood flow and nutrient delivery. However, they can also have side effects related to how the body uses sugar. The review found no clear evidence that betamimetic drugs improve baby growth or reduce risks. More research is needed to see if these drugs are truly helpful and safe. It is important to also understand any potential harmful effects of these drugs alongside their potential benefits.	This study looked at the effects of betamimetics, a type of medicine, on babies born prematurely. Betamimetics can help babies grow by increasing the availability of nutrients and by reducing the risk of blood vessel resistance. However, they can also cause side effects due to their effects on the body's metabolism. The study found that there was no clear difference between the betamimetics group and the control group in terms of low birth weight, other physical measures, or neonatal health or death. More and better studies are needed to understand the effects of betamimetics on babies' growth. Because betamimetics can cause side effects, more research is needed to understand their potential risks and benefits.
29	We are uncertain whether opioids have an effect on pain and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24 months; the use of morphine or fentanyl probably has little or no effect in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and neonatal mortality. Data on the other comparisons planned in this review (opioids versus analgesics; opioids versus other opioids) are extremely limited and do not allow any conclusions. In the absence of firm evidence to support a routine policy, opioids should be used selectively - based on clinical judgement and evaluation of pain indicators - although pain measurement in newborns has limitations.	We're not sure if opioids have an effect on pain and how well babies develop their brains and bodies by the time they are 18 to 24 months old. Morphine or fentanyl probably don't make much difference in how long babies need to be on a breathing machine or how likely they are to die. We didn't have enough information to tell if these medicines were better than other pain-relieving medicines or if one type of pain-relieving medicine was better than another.	We're not sure if opioids help with pain and brain development at 18 to 24 months old. We also don't know if morphine or fentanyl help with breathing problems or death in newborns. We don't have enough information to say for sure if opioids are better than other pain relievers or other pain relievers. We also don't have enough information to say for sure if opioids are better than other pain relievers or other pain relievers. We don't have enough information to say for sure if opioids are better than other pain relievers. We need more research to be sure if opioids are better than other pain relievers.
30	Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) preparations were intended to avoid the adverse effects of sulfasalazine (SASP) while maintaining its therapeutic benefits. It was previously found that 5-ASA drugs in doses of at least 2 g/day were more effective than placebo but no more effective than SASP for inducing remission in ulcerative colitis (UC). This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.	Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) medications were developed to avoid the side effects of sulfasalazine (SASP) while still providing the same benefits. Earlier studies showed that 5-ASA medications in doses of at least 2 grams per day were more effective than a placebo, but no more effective than SASP, for putting ulcerative colitis (UC) into remission. This review is an update of a previously published review.	Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) preparations were designed to avoid the side effects of sulfasalazine (SASP), a drug used to treat ulcerative colitis (UC), while still providing therapeutic benefits. It was previously found that 5-ASA preparations in doses of at least 2 g/day were more effective than a placebo but not more effective than SASP in bringing ulcerative colitis (UC) into remission. This review is an update of a previous review.
31	Preterm infants are born with low glycogen stores and require higher glucose intake to match fetal accretion rates. In spite of the myriad benefits of breast milk for preterm infants, it may not adequately meet the needs of these rapidly growing infants. Supplementing human milk with carbohydrates may help. However, there is a paucity of data on assessment of benefits or harms of carbohydrate supplementation of human milk to promote growth in preterm infants. This is a 2020 update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1999.	Babies who are born too early have low levels of a natural sugar called glycogen.  They need a lot of sugar to grow properly.  Breast milk is great for premature babies, but it might not have enough sugar for them to grow as quickly as they need.  Giving them extra sugar in their breast milk might help.  But we don't have enough information about whether this extra sugar is good or bad for premature babies. This is a new report about a study that was first done in 1999.	Premature babies are born with low glycogen stores and need more glucose to keep up with their growing bodies. Even though breast milk is good for premature babies, it might not be enough to meet their needs. Adding carbohydrates to human milk might help. However, we don't have enough information about whether adding carbohydrates to human milk helps or hurts premature babies. This is an updated version of a review that was first published in 1999.
32	Two independent investigators assessed studies for eligibility and risk of bias. Data from individual studies were extracted using standardised forms and pooled according to a published protocol. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes.	Two different experts looked at all the studies to decide which ones were relevant and how reliable they were. They then used special forms to gather information from the studies and combine it according to a set of rules.  The results were presented as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), along with how confident we can be in these numbers.	Two independent researchers looked at the studies to see if they met our criteria and if they had any problems with how they were done. They collected data from each study using standard forms and combined it according to a published protocol. They then combined the results of the studies using a random-effects model. The results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for outcomes that were either positive or negative, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for outcomes that were continuous.
33	During percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and in non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS), the risk of acute vessel occlusion by thrombosis is high. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers strongly inhibit platelet aggregation and may prevent mortality and myocardial infarction. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001, and previously updated in 2007 and 2010. To assess the efficacy and safety effects of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers when administered during PCI, and as initial medical treatment in patients with NSTEACS. We updated the searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library (Issue 12, 2012), MEDLINE (OVID, 1946 to January Week 1 2013) and EMBASE (OVID, 1947 to Week 1 2013) on 11 January 2013. Randomised controlled trials comparing intravenous IIb/IIIa blockers with placebo or usual care. Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data. We collected major bleeding as adverse effect information from the trials. We used odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for effect measures. Sixty trials involving 66,689 patients were included. During PCI (48 trials with 33,513 participants) glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers decreased all-cause mortality at 30 days (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.97) but not at six months (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05). All-cause death or myocardial infarction was decreased both at 30 days (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.72) and at six months (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86), although severe bleeding was increased (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.61; absolute risk increase (ARI) 8.0 per 1000). The efficacy results were homogeneous for every endpoint according to the clinical condition of the patients, but were less marked for patients pre-treated with clopidogrel, especially in patients without acute coronary syndromes. As initial medical treatment of NSTEACS (12 trials with 33,176 participants), IIb/IIIa blockers did not decrease mortality at 30 days (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.02) or at six months (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.15), but slightly decreased death or myocardial infarction at 30 days (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98) and at six months (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96), although severe bleeding was increased (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.45; ARI 1.4 per 1000). When administered during PCI, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers reduce the risk of all-cause death at 30 days but not at six months, and reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction at 30 days and at six months, at a price of an increase in the risk of severe bleeding. The efficacy effects are homogeneous but are less marked in patients pre-treated with clopidogrel where they seem to be effective only in patients with acute coronary syndromes. When administered as initial medical treatment in patients with NSTEACS, these agents do not reduce mortality although they slightly reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction.	This study looked at the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers, which are medicines that help prevent blood clots, in people having a heart procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or in people with a type of heart problem called non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS). The study found that these blockers can reduce the risk of death and heart attack in people having PCI, but they can also increase the risk of bleeding. The study also found that these blockers do not reduce death in people with NSTEACS, but they may slightly reduce the risk of death or heart attack.	This study looked at the effectiveness and safety of a type of blood thinner called glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS). NSTEACS is a serious condition where blood clots build up in the blood vessels. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers are a type of blood thinner that can block platelet aggregation and may help prevent death and heart attacks. The researchers reviewed many studies that compared glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers to a placebo (a fake pill) or usual care. They found that glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers were effective in preventing death and heart attacks during PCI and as an initial treatment for NSTEACS. They also found that glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers were less effective than clopidogrel, especially in people without acute coronary syndromes.
34	We identified no new studies for inclusion in this 2018 update. We included in the review 18 trials with a total of 2197 participants. We were not able to include one study in the meta-analysis because it provided no data that we could extract. Most of the studies carried a high risk of bias because of high or unclear risk related to randomisation and blinding. Meta-analysis showed that, compared with heparin alone, or heparin plus placebo, thrombolytics plus heparin can reduce the odds of death (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.87, 2167 participants, P = 0.01, low-quality evidence) and recurrence of PE (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.89, 1898 participants, P = 0.02, low-quality evidence). Effects on mortality weakened when we excluded from analysis four studies at high risk of bias (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.06, 2054 participants, P = 0.08). The incidence of major and minor haemorrhagic events was higher in the thrombolytics group than in the control group (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.95 to 4.31, 1897 participants, P < 0.001, low-quality evidence; OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.58 to 6.06, 1553 participants, P = 0.001, very low-quality evidence, respectively). We downgraded the quality of the evidence to low or very low because of design limitations, potential influence of pharmaceutical companies, and small sample sizes. Length of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) -0.89, 95% CI -3.13 to 1.34) and quality of life were similar between the two treatment groups. Limited information from a small number of trials indicated that thrombolytics may improve haemodynamic outcomes, perfusion lung scanning, pulmonary angiogram assessment, echocardiograms, pulmonary hypertension, coagulation parameters, clinical outcomes, and survival time to a greater extent than heparin alone. However, the heterogeneity of the studies and the small number of participants involved warrant caution when results are interpreted. Similarily, fewer participants from the thrombolytics group required escalation of treatment. None of the included studies reported on post-thrombotic syndrome or compared the costs of different treatments.	This review looked at 18 studies on using clot-busting drugs (thrombolytics) along with heparin to treat blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism). The studies had some problems with how they were designed, so we can't be completely sure of the results. The review found that clot-busting drugs might help people live longer and reduce the chance of getting a blood clot again. But they also increase the risk of bleeding.  The results also showed that clot-busting drugs might improve some other measures related to blood clots.  However, more research is needed because the studies were small and had some differences.	This study looked at whether giving a medicine called thrombolytics to people with a lung condition called pulmonary embolism (PE) is better than giving heparin alone or heparin plus heparin. The study found that thrombolytics might help reduce the chances of death and recurrence of PE compared to giving heparin alone. However, the evidence was not very strong because the studies were small and had some limitations. The study also found that thrombolytics might help people stay in the hospital longer and improve their quality of life. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings.
35	The prevalence of nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life expectancy and increases the risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and requirement for liver transplantation. There is uncertainty surrounding the relative benefits and harms of various lifestyle interventions for people with NAFLD.	A lot of people have a condition called fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that's not caused by alcohol. Between 19% and 33% of people in different places have it. Having NAFLD can shorten your life and increase your chances of getting serious liver problems, including cirrhosis, liver cancer, and needing a liver transplant. We're not completely sure how helpful different ways of changing your lifestyle are for people with NAFLD.	The number of people with nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different groups. NAFLD can make people live longer and increase the risk of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and needing a liver transplant. There is uncertainty about the benefits and risks of different lifestyle interventions for people with NAFLD.

37	Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are significant contributors to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. These disorders include well-controlled chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension (pregnancy-induced hypertension) and mild pre-eclampsia. The definitive treatment for these disorders is planned early delivery and the alternative is to manage the pregnancy expectantly if severe uncontrolled hypertension is not present, with close maternal and fetal monitoring. There are benefits and risks associated with both, so it is important to establish the safest option.	High blood pressure during pregnancy can lead to serious problems for both the mother and baby. These problems include high blood pressure that was present before pregnancy, high blood pressure that develops during pregnancy, and a condition called pre-eclampsia.  The best way to treat these conditions is to plan for an early delivery.  If the blood pressure isn't dangerously high, doctors might manage the pregnancy without early delivery, but they'll need to carefully monitor both the mother and baby. Both options have benefits and risks, so it's important to figure out the safest one.	High blood pressure during pregnancy is a big problem for both the mother and the baby. It can lead to serious health problems and even death for both the mother and the baby. There are three main types of high blood pressure during pregnancy: well-controlled chronic high blood pressure, gestational high blood pressure (pregnancy-induced high blood pressure), and mild pre-eclampsia. The best way to treat these disorders is to plan for delivery early. The other option is to manage the pregnancy expectantly if severe high blood pressure isn't present, with close monitoring of both the mother and the baby. There are both benefits and risks to both, so it's important to figure out the safest option.
38	We searched four databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO) from inception to May 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of remotely-delivered psychological interventions for children and adolescents with chronic pain. We searched for chronic pain conditions including, but not exclusive to, headache, recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, and neuropathic pain. We also searched online trial registries, reference sections, and citations of included studies for potential trials.	We looked at studies on using technology to help children and teenagers with chronic pain. We searched four big databases for studies that compared these tech-based treatments to other ways of helping pain, or no treatment at all. We focused on studies where children and teenagers had chronic pain, like headaches, stomach aches, muscle pain, or nerve pain. We also checked online trial registries, and the references and citations of the studies we found.	We looked for studies that tested remote-delivered psychological interventions for children and teenagers with chronic pain. We searched four databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO) from the beginning of the study to May 2018. We wanted to see if these interventions could help children and teenagers with chronic pain. We looked for chronic pain conditions like headaches, recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, and neuropathic pain. We also looked at online trial registries, reference sections, and citations of the studies we included to see if there were any potential studies.
39	Tianma Gouteng Yin Formula (TGYF) is widely used to treat hypertension-related symptoms in clinical practice in East Asia. It has been shown to have a blood pressure lowering effect, reducing total cholesterol, improving clinical symptoms and quality of life, and preventing the occurrence of stroke in hypertensive patients. Understanding the effect of Tianma Gouteng Yin Formula on blood pressure, quality of life and cardiovascular risk factors could be valuable for the management of high blood pressure. To assess the efficacy and safety of Tianma Gouteng Yin Formula for treating primary hypertension compared to placebo or no treatment. English databases including Cochrane Central (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, IPA, and the Hypertension Group Specialised Register were searched up to July 2011. Chinese databases including Chinese Biomedical Database, TCMonline, Chinese Dissertation Database, CMAC and the Index to Chinese Periodical Literature were searched up to April 2010. Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared TGYF with no treatment or placebo for primary hypertension. No study was identified which met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was identified which met the inclusion criteria for this review. As no trials could be identified, no conclusions can be made about the role of TGYF in the treatment of primary hypertension. Well-designed randomized controlled studies need to be conducted and published.	Tianma Gouteng Yin Formula (TGYF) is a traditional Chinese medicine often used to treat high blood pressure symptoms in East Asia. Studies have shown that it can lower blood pressure, reduce cholesterol, improve overall health and quality of life, and even help prevent strokes in people with high blood pressure. Researchers wanted to figure out if TGYF is actually effective and safe for treating high blood pressure. To do this, they searched through a lot of medical databases, including international ones like Cochrane Central (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Chinese ones like Chinese Biomedical Database and TCMonline, looking for studies that compared TGYF to either no treatment or a placebo (a fake treatment). However, they couldn't find any suitable studies that met their criteria. This means we don't have enough information to say whether TGYF is a good treatment for high blood pressure. More research is needed in the form of well-designed studies to understand the true effects of TGYF.	Tianma Gouteng Yin Formula (TGYF) is a popular medicine used to treat high blood pressure in East Asia. It has been shown to lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol, improve symptoms and quality of life, and prevent strokes in people with high blood pressure. We wanted to find out if Tianma Gouteng Yin Formula is effective and safe for treating high blood pressure. We searched for studies that compared TGYF to no treatment or a fake treatment (placebo). We couldn't find any studies that met our criteria, so we can't say for sure if TGYF is a good treatment for high blood pressure. We need more well-designed studies to be sure.
40	We included eight studies examining the blood pressure lowering efficacy of carvedilol and labetalol in 1493 hypertensive patients. Five of the included studies were parallel design; three were cross-over design. The two largest included studies were unpublished carvedilol studies. The estimates of BP lowering effect (systolic BP/diastolic BP millimeters of mercury; SPB/DBP mm Hg) were -4 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals (CI) -6 to -2)/-3 mm Hg (95% CI -4 to -2) for carvedilol (>1000 subjects) and -10 mm Hg (95% CI -14 to -7)/-7 mm Hg (95% CI -9 to -5) for labetalol (110 subjects). The effect of labetalol is likely to be exaggerated due to high risk of bias. Carvedilol, within the recommended dose range, did not show a significant dose response effect for SBP or DBP. Carvedilol had little or no effect on pulse pressure (-1 mm Hg) and did not change BP variability. Overall, once and twice the starting dose of carvedilol and labetalol lowered BP by -6 mm Hg (95% CI -7 to -4) /-4 mm Hg (95% CI -4 to -3) (low quality evidence) and lowered heart rate by five beats per minute (95% CI -6 to -4) (low quality evidence). Five studies (N = 1412) reported withdrawal due to adverse effects; the risk ratio was 0.88 (95% CI 0.54 to 1.42) (moderate quality evidence).	This study looked at how well two drugs, carvedilol and labetalol, lowered blood pressure in 1493 people with high blood pressure. Both drugs work by blocking certain receptors in the body that control blood pressure. The study found that both drugs lowered blood pressure, but labetalol may have shown a larger effect due to some potential problems in how the study was conducted. Carvedilol didn't show any difference in blood pressure lowering effect when used at different doses within the recommended range. Overall, both drugs lowered blood pressure and heart rate, but the evidence for this is not very strong.  Finally, the study looked at how often people stopped taking the drugs because of side effects. It found that there wasn't a significant difference in the number of people who stopped taking the drugs compared to those taking a placebo (sugar pill).	This study looked at whether two medicines, carvedilol and labetalol, could help lower blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. The study included 1493 people with high blood pressure. The study found that carvedilol and labetalol were effective in lowering blood pressure. However, labetalol was more likely to cause side effects than carvedilol. The study also found that carvedilol didn't have a significant effect on blood pressure or pulse pressure. Carvedilol didn't have a significant effect on pulse pressure, and it didn't change blood pressure variability. Overall, carvedilol and labetalol were effective in lowering blood pressure and lowering heart rate. However, some people stopped taking carvedilol because of side effects.
41	Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the risk of bias of the trials, and data extraction were conducted independently and in duplicate. Authors were contacted for any missing information. Results were expressed using fixed-effect models as there were either less than four studies or we used Peto odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous data when there were zero cells in either the treatment or control or both arms and the number of trials was small. The statistical unit of the analysis was the patient.	We looked at each of the studies to make sure they were suitable for our review and to see how likely they were to be biased. We looked at the studies twice to make sure we got everything right. If we were missing any information, we contacted the authors of the studies. We used a fixed-effect model to combine the results of the studies. This is because there were fewer than four studies, or we had to use Peto odds ratios (ORs) for results that were counted as 'yes' or 'no' when there were no results in either the treatment or control groups, or both, and the number of studies was small. We focused on the results for each patient.	We looked at all the studies that met our criteria, assessed how likely the studies were to be biased, and extracted data from them. We did all this independently and in duplicate. We contacted the authors of the studies for any missing information. We used a statistical method called fixed-effect models to express the results when there were less than four studies or we used Peto odds ratios (ORs) when there were zero cells in either the treatment or control group or both groups and the number of studies was small.

42	Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common paediatric soft-tissue sarcoma and can emerge throughout the whole body. For patients with newly diagnosed RMS, prognosis for survival depends on multiple factors such as histology, tumour site, and extent of the disease. Patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis have impaired prognosis compared to those with localised disease. Appropriate staging at diagnosis therefore plays an important role in choosing the right treatment regimen for an individual patient. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional molecular imaging technique that uses the increased glycolysis of cancer cells to visualise both structural information and metabolic activity. 18F-FDG-PET combined with computed tomography (CT) could help to accurately stage the extent of disease in patients with newly diagnosed RMS. In this review we aimed to evaluate whether 18F-FDG-PET could replace other imaging modalities for the staging of distant metastases in RMS.	Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a type of cancer that affects soft tissues and is most common in children. It can appear anywhere in the body.  How well a patient with newly diagnosed RMS does depends on things like the type of cancer, where it is located, and how widespread it is. Patients with cancer that has spread have a worse outlook than those with localized disease. So, accurately determining the stage of the cancer at diagnosis is very important for choosing the right treatment.  Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is a type of imaging that shows how active cells are in the body. Cancer cells are very active, so PET scans can be used to detect and track them.  We wanted to see if PET scans, combined with a CT scan, could accurately determine the spread of cancer in patients with newly diagnosed RMS, and if this could replace other methods used to diagnose spread of cancer.	Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a type of cancer that can spread to other parts of the body. It's the most common type of sarcoma in children and can affect many parts of the body. For people who have recently been diagnosed with RMS, their chances of survival depend on many factors, including the type of tumor, the location of the tumor, and the extent of the cancer. People with RMS that has spread to other parts of the body are less likely to survive compared to those with RMS that has spread to other parts of the body. It's important to choose the right treatment plan for each individual patient. Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (PET) positron emission tomography (PET) is a new type of imaging technique that uses the growth of cancer cells to see their structure and activity. Combining 18F-FDG-PET with computed tomography (CT) could help diagnose RMS more accurately. This review aims to see if 18F-FDG-PET could replace other imaging modalities for diagnosing distant metastases in RMS.
43	Alzheimer's disease sufferers have been found to lack the enzyme responsible for converting choline into acetylcholine within the brain. Lecithin is a major dietary source of choline, so extra consumption may reduce the progression of dementia. To determine the efficacy of lecithin in the treatment of dementia or cognitive impairment. The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register was searched on 6 May 2004 using the terms lecithin and phosphatidylcholine. This register contains records from all major databases and many trials databases and is updated regularly. Reference lists and relevant books have been examined. All unconfounded, randomized trials comparing lecithin with placebo in a treatment period longer than one day, in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type, vascular dementia, mixed vascular and Alzheimer's disease, unclassified or other dementia or unclassified cognitive impairment not fulfilling the criteria for dementia are eligible for inclusion. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers and cross-checked. Meta-analyses were performed when more than one trial provided data on a comparable outcome on sufficiently similar patients. Random effects analyses were performed whenever heterogeneity between results appeared to be present. Standardised differences in mean outcome measures were used due to the use of different scales and periods of treatment. Odds ratios for dichotomous data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel or DerSimonian and Laird methods. Twelve randomized trials have been identified involving patients with Alzheimer's disease (265 patients), Parkinsonian dementia (21 patients) and subjective memory problems (90 patients). No trials reported any clear clinical benefit of lecithin for Alzheimer's disease or Parkinsonian dementia. Few trials contributed data to meta-analyses. The only statistically significant result was in favour of placebo for adverse events, based on one trial, which appears likely to be a spurious result. A dramatic result in favour of lecithin was obtained in a trial of subjects with subjective memory problems. Evidence from randomized trials does not support the use of lecithin in the treatment of patients with dementia. A moderate effect cannot be ruled out, but results from the small trials to date do not indicate priority for a large randomized trial.	People with Alzheimer's disease have been found to lack an important ingredient in their brains called acetylcholine.  Lecithin, found in food, provides this ingredient.  Researchers wanted to see if giving people with dementia extra lecithin could help.  They looked at 12 studies that tested giving lecithin to people with dementia.  These studies included people with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and people who thought they had memory problems.  The studies found that lecithin did not help people with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease.  There was some evidence that lecithin helped people with memory problems, but more research is needed.  Overall, the research does not suggest that lecithin is a good treatment for dementia.	This study looked at whether lecithin, a type of choline, can help people with Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a condition where the brain doesn't make enough of a chemical called choline. Lecithin is a good source of choline, so if people eat more lecithin, it might help slow down the progression of dementia. The researchers reviewed many studies that compared lecithin to a fake pill (placebo) in people with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinsonian dementia, or memory problems. They found that lecithin didn't seem to help people with dementia. They also found that lecithin didn't seem to help people with memory problems. However, more research is needed to see if lecithin is a good treatment for dementia.
44	Three review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts for potentially eligible studies, for which we then obtained full-text reports. Two authors then independently confirmed eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane'Risk of bias' tool. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence.	Three different researchers reviewed all the titles and summaries of the studies we found. They looked to see if the studies might be helpful. Then, we got the full reports for those studies. Two researchers then worked together to decide if the studies were useful, and they gathered information from them. They also assessed how likely the studies were to be biased using a tool called the Cochraneâ€™Risk of biasâ€™ tool. Finally, we used a method called the GRADE approach to determine the overall quality of the evidence.	Three different people looked at the titles and summaries of the studies to see if they met our criteria. They then read the full reports of the studies. Two other people checked if the studies met our criteria, collected data, and assessed how reliable the studies were using a tool called the Cochrane'Risk of bias' tool. We used a system called GRADE to assess the overall quality of the evidence.
45	The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of balanced solutions on mortality during hospitalization in severely dehydrated children. However, balanced solutions likely result in a slight reduction of the time in the hospital compared to 0.9% saline. Also, balanced solutions likely reduce the risk of hypokalaemia after intravenous correction. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that balanced solutions compared to 0.9% saline probably produce no changes in the need for additional intravenous fluids or in other biochemical measures such as sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels. Last, there may be no difference between balanced solutions and 0.9% saline in the incidence of hyponatraemia.	It's not completely clear how giving balanced solutions (special fluids) to severely dehydrated children in the hospital affects whether they die. However, balanced solutions might make them stay in the hospital for a shorter time compared to giving them a different solution called 0.9% saline. Balanced solutions might also help reduce the risk of low potassium levels in the blood after the fluids are given.  The evidence suggests that balanced solutions might not change the need for more fluids or affect other blood tests like sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels. Lastly, there might not be a difference between balanced solutions and 0.9% saline in how often children develop low sodium levels in the blood.	We don't know for sure if giving balanced solutions to severely dehydrated children helps them survive in the hospital. However, balanced solutions might slightly reduce the time they spend in the hospital compared to a standard solution of 0.9% saline. Also, balanced solutions likely reduce the risk of low potassium levels after intravenous correction. The evidence suggests that balanced solutions probably don't change the need for extra intravenous fluids or other biochemical measures like sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels. Finally, there might be no difference between balanced solutions and 0.9% saline in the incidence of hyponatraemia.
46	We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcome was the proportion of children with manifest strabismus, as defined by study investigators. Other outcomes included the amblyopia, stereoacuity, and the effect of spectacle use of strabismus and visual acuity. We also collected information on change in refractive error as a measurement of the interference of emmetropization.	We followed standard research methods to conduct this study.  The main thing we were looking at was how many children developed crossed eyes (strabismus).  We also looked at things like lazy eye (amblyopia), how well the children could see in 3D (stereoacuity), and whether wearing glasses had any impact on their crossed eyes or eyesight.  We also collected information on changes in their eye prescription, which tells us if their eyesight was changing in a way that might affect their vision development.	We used standard research methods to conduct this study. Our main goal was to see how many children had clear strabismus, as defined by the study investigators. We also looked at other things like amblyopia, stereoacuity, and the effect of using spectacles on strabismus and visual acuity. We also collected information on the change in refractive error as a measure of the interference of emmetropization.
47	The role of endoscopic head and neck surgery in the management of OPSCC is clearly expanding as evidenced by its more overt incorporation into the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Data are mounting regarding its outcomes both in terms of survival and lower morbidity. As confidence increases, it is being used in the management of more advanced OPSCC. Based on this review, there is currently no high-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding clinical outcomes for patients with oropharyngeal cancer receiving endoscopic head and neck surgery compared with primary chemoradiotherapy.	Doctors are increasingly using a special type of surgery called endoscopic head and neck surgery to treat a type of cancer called oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). This surgery is becoming more common because it seems to be effective and cause fewer side effects.  However, there haven't been any large-scale studies that directly compare this surgery to traditional treatments like radiation and chemotherapy to see which works better for patients.	Endoscopic head and neck surgery (endoscopic head and neck surgery) is becoming more common in treating oropharyngeal cancer (OPSCC), which is a type of cancer that affects the throat, nose, and throat. It's becoming more common in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. More and more studies are being done to see how well it works in terms of how long people live and how well it reduces the risk of complications. As more people are confident, endoscopic head and neck surgery is being used to treat more advanced OPSCC. However, there is currently no high-quality evidence from studies comparing endoscopic head and neck surgery to primary chemoradiotherapy for treating oropharyngeal cancer.
48	"We included two studies with a total of 141 participants (aged 7 to 18 years) with chronic neuropathic pain, complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS-I), or fibromyalgia. One study investigated pregabalin versus placebo in participants with fibromyalgia (107 participants), and the other study investigated gabapentin versus amitriptyline in participants with CRPS-I or neuropathic pain (34 participants). We were unable to perform any quantitative analysis. Risk of bias for the two included studies varied, due to issues with randomisation (low to unclear risk), blinding of outcome assessors (low to unclear risk), reporting bias (low to unclear risk), the size of the study populations (high risk), and industry funding in the'other' domain (low to unclear risk). We judged the remaining domains of sequence generation, blinding of participants and personnel, and attrition as low risk of bias. Primary outcomes One study (gabapentin 900 mg/day versus amitriptyline 10 mg/day, 34 participants, for 6 weeks) did not report our primary outcomes. The second study (pregabalin 75 to 450 mg/day versus placebo 75 to 450 mg/day, 107 participants, for 15 weeks) reported no significant change in pain scores for pain relief of 30% or greater between pregabalin 18/54 (33.3%), and placebo 16/51 (31.4%), P = 0.83 (very low-quality evidence). This study also reported Patient Global Impression of Change, with the percentage of participants feeling ""much or very much improved"" with pregabalin 53.1%, and placebo 29.5% (very low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes In one small study, adverse events were uncommon: gabapentin 2 participants (2 adverse events); amitriptyline 1 participant (1 adverse event) (6-week trial). The second study reported a higher number of adverse events: pregabalin 38 participants (167 adverse events); placebo 34 participants (132 adverse events) (15-week trial) (very low-quality evidence). Withdrawals due to adverse events were infrequent in both studies: pregabalin (4 participants), placebo (4 participants), gabapentin (2 participants), and amitriptyline (1 participant) (very low-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were reported in both studies. One study reported only one serious adverse event (cholelithiasis and major depression resulting in hospitalisation in the pregabalin group) and the other study reported no serious adverse events (very low-quality evidence). There were few or no data for our remaining secondary outcomes. Quality of evidence For the outcomes with available data, we downgraded the quality of the evidence by three levels to very low-quality due to too few data and the fact that the number of events was too small to be meaningful."	This study looked at the use of two medications, pregabalin and gabapentin, to treat chronic pain in children and teenagers. The study found that there was not enough evidence to say whether these medications were effective or not. The study also found that these medications had some side effects.	This study looked at two different pain medications, pregabalin and amitriptyline, for people with chronic neuropathic pain, complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS-I), or fibromyalgia. The first study compared pregabalin to a fake medicine (placebo) in people with fibromyalgia or CRPS-I. The second study compared pregabalin to amitriptyline in people with CRPS-I or CRPS-I. The study found that pregabalin didn't seem to make a difference in pain relief. However, there were some problems with how the studies were conducted, such as making sure people were randomly assigned to receive pregabalin or amitriptyline, reporting bias, and reporting bias. Overall, the study found that pregabalin didn't seem to help people with CRPS-I or CRPS-I. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings.
49	There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid dressings in the healing of pressure ulcers or foot ulcers in people with diabetes. We found evidence that hyaluronic acid probably improves complete ulcer healing and may slightly decrease pain and increase change in ulcer size when compared with neutral vehicle. Future research into the effects of hyaluronic acid in the healing of chronic wounds should consider higher sample size and blinding to minimise bias and improve the quality of evidence.	There isn't enough evidence to say for sure whether putting hyaluronic acid on pressure sores or foot ulcers in people with diabetes helps them heal. We found some evidence that hyaluronic acid might help ulcers heal completely, and it might also slightly reduce pain and make the ulcers a bit smaller. But we need more research with more people involved and better ways of doing the research to make sure we can trust the results.

50	We used the standardized methods for conducting a systematic review as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two authors independently extracted details of trial methodology and outcome data from reports of all trials considered eligible for inclusion. We made all analyses on an intention-to-treat basis. We used a fixed-effect model where there was no evidence of significant heterogeneity between studies and a random-effects model if heterogeneity was likely.	We followed standard methods for doing a systematic review, as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two different people independently looked at each study and recorded information about how it was done and the results. We analyzed all the studies together, including those where people stopped participating before the end. We used a statistical model that assumes all the studies are similar, unless there was clear evidence that they were different.

51	We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. overall participant survival, 2. quality of life, and 3. serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were 4. graft survival, 5. ischaemic biliary complications, 6. primary non-function of the graft, 7. early allograft function, 8. non-serious adverse events, 9. transplant utilisation, and 10. transaminase release during the first week post-transplant. We assessed bias using Cochrane's RoB 2 tool and used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence.	This study looked at different methods for preserving donated livers before they are transplanted into people. The main things we were interested in were how long people lived after the transplant, their quality of life, and any serious problems they had. We also looked at how well the new liver worked, whether there were any problems with the bile ducts, whether the new liver started working right away, and any other side effects, both serious and minor. We made sure to carefully check for any bias in the studies we looked at and we rated the quality of the evidence for each outcome.	This study looked at whether a kidney transplant helped people live longer, improve their quality of life, and reduce the risk of serious side effects. We used standard research methods to analyze the data. We were mainly interested in how long people lived, their quality of life, and any serious side effects. We also looked at how long people lived after the transplant, if they had problems with their bile ducts, if the transplant didn't work properly, and if they had any side effects. We also looked at how long people lived after the transplant, if they had problems with their bile ducts, if they had problems with their bile ducts, if they had problems with their bile ducts early on, if they had any serious side effects, how often they used the transplant, and if they had any problems with their bile ducts. We used a tool called Cochrane's RoB 2 and GRADE to assess how reliable the evidence was.
52	This is an updated version of a Cochrane Review previously published in 2019. Catamenial epilepsy describes worsening seizures in relation to the menstrual cycle and may affect around 40% of women with epilepsy. Vulnerable days of the menstrual cycle for seizures are perimenstrually (C1 pattern), at ovulation (C2 pattern), and during the luteal phase (C3 pattern). A reduction in progesterone levels premenstrually and reduced secretion during the luteal phase is implicated in catamenial C1 and C3 patterns. A reduction in progesterone has been demonstrated to reduce sensitivity to the inhibitory neurotransmitter in preclinical studies, hence increasing risk of seizures. A pre-ovulatory surge in oestrogen has been implicated in the C2 pattern of seizure exacerbation, although the exact mechanism by which this surge increases risk is uncertain. Current treatment practices include the use of pulsed hormonal (e.g. progesterone) and non-hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) in women with regular menses, and complete cessation of menstruation using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (triptorelin and goserelin)) in women with irregular menses. Catamenial epilepsy and seizure exacerbation is common in women with epilepsy. Women may not receive appropriate treatment for their seizures because of uncertainty regarding which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatment should be taken, as well as the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health. This review aims to address these issues to inform clinical practice and future research.	This review is about a condition called catamenial epilepsy, where seizures happen more often around a woman's menstrual cycle. This affects about 40% of women with epilepsy. Women with this condition may have seizures during their period (C1 pattern), around ovulation (C2 pattern), or during the second half of their cycle (C3 pattern). The review looks at how hormones like progesterone might affect seizures. A drop in progesterone levels before and during the second half of the cycle may increase the risk of seizures.  A surge in estrogen around ovulation may also play a role in seizures. The review also looks at treatments, such as hormone medications (progesterone) or other anti-seizure medications (clobazam or acetazolamide), to manage seizures.  The review discusses the challenges of treating catamenial epilepsy, including finding the best treatment and how it might affect a woman's fertility, menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health.	Catamenial epilepsy is a condition where seizures get worse during the menstrual cycle. It affects about 40% of women with epilepsy. The most common days of the menstrual cycle for seizures are perimenstrually (C1 pattern), at ovulation (C2 pattern), and during the luteal phase (C3 pattern). A decrease in progesterone levels before menstruation and reduced secretion during ovulation are linked to catamenial C1 and C3. A surge in oestrogen has been shown to increase the risk of seizures, but we don't know exactly how this surge increases risk. Current treatment options include using pulsed hormonal (e.g. progesterone) and non-hormonal treatments (e.g. clobazam or acetazolamide) in women with regular menses, and complete cessation of menstruation using synthetic hormones (e.g. medroxyprogesterone or goserelin) in women with irregular menses. Catamenial epilepsy and seizures are common in women with epilepsy because of uncertainty about which treatment works best and when in the menstrual cycle treatment, as well as the possible impact on fertility, the menstrual cycle, bone health, and cardiovascular health.

53	Randomized controlled comparisons which included men with clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma where hypofractionated radiation therapy (external beam radiation therapy) to the prostate using hypofractionation (greater than 2 Gy per fraction) compared with conventionally fractionated radiation therapy to the prostate delivered using standard fractionation (1.8 Gy to 2 Gy per fraction).	This study looked at men with prostate cancer who were given radiation therapy.  The study compared two different ways of giving radiation: one way used a higher dose of radiation given fewer times (hypofractionated), while the other way used a lower dose of radiation given more times (conventionally fractionated).	This study looked at men with a type of prostate cancer called adenocarcinoma that affects the prostate. They compared men who received radiation therapy to their prostate using a special technique called hypofractionation (external beam radiation therapy) to men who received standard fractionation (1.8 Gy to 2 Gy per fraction).
54	We identified two new studies (89 participants) in this updated review. A total of 11 studies (1760 participants) met the entry criteria of the review, one of which accounted for 68% of recruited participants. The quality of evidence ranged from low to moderate owing to an unclear risk of bias across many studies, lack of blinding and low participant numbers for some outcomes. Eight of the studies compared LVRS versus standard medical care, one compared two closure techniques (stapling vs laser ablation), one looked at the effect of buttressing the staple line on the effectiveness of LVRS and one compared traditional'resectional' LVRS with a non-resectional surgical approach. Participants completed a mandatory course of pulmonary rehabilitation/physical training before the procedure commenced. Short-term mortality was higher for LVRS (odds ratio (OR) 6.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.22 to 11.79; 1489 participants; five studies; moderate-quality evidence) than for control, but long-term mortality favoured LVRS (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95; 1280 participants; two studies; moderate-quality evidence). Participants identified post hoc as being at high risk of death from surgery were those with particularly impaired lung function, poor diffusing capacity and/or homogenous emphysema. Participants with upper lobe-predominant emphysema and low baseline exercise capacity showed the most favourable outcomes related to mortality, as investigators reported no significant differences in early mortality between participants treated with LVRS and those in the control group (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.23 to 3.29; 290 participants; one study), as well as significantly lower mortality at the end of follow-up for LVRS compared with control (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78; 290 participants; one study). Trials in this review furthermore provided evidence of low to moderate quality showing that improvements in lung function parameters other than forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), quality of life and exercise capacity were more likely with LVRS than with usual follow-up. Adverse events were more common with LVRS than with control, specifically the occurrence of (persistent) air leaks, pulmonary morbidity (e.g. pneumonia) and cardiovascular morbidity. Although LVRS leads to an increase in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), the procedure is relatively costly overall.	This study looked at a treatment called LVRS for people with severe lung disease. LVRS is a surgery that removes damaged parts of the lung. The study found that LVRS can improve lung function, quality of life, and exercise ability, but it also has risks, such as air leaks, pneumonia, and heart problems. The study also found that LVRS is expensive. Overall, the study suggests that LVRS can be helpful for some people with severe lung disease, but itâ€™s important to weigh the benefits and risks carefully.	This study looked at whether a procedure called LVRS can improve lung function, quality of life, and exercise. The study found that LVRS was more effective in the short term than standard medical care. However, LVRS was more effective in the long term. People with emphysema were more likely to die from surgery. The study also found that LVRS might improve lung function, quality of life, and exercise ability. However, LVRS was more likely to cause side effects, such as persistent air leaks and lung problems.
55	We identified three trials that evaluated use of prophylactic glycerin laxatives in preterm infants. We identified no trials that evaluated therapeutic use of glycerin laxatives for feeding intolerance. Our review showed that prophylactic administration of glycerin laxatives did not reduce the time required to achieve full enteral feeds and did not influence secondary outcomes, including duration of hospital stay, mortality and weight at discharge. Prophylactic administration of glycerin laxatives resulted in failure of fewer infants to pass stool over the first 48 hours. Included trials reported no adverse events.	We found three studies that looked at giving glycerin laxatives to prevent constipation in babies born early. We did not find any studies that looked at using glycerin laxatives to treat feeding problems in babies. Our review showed that giving glycerin laxatives to prevent constipation did not help babies start eating sooner or make them healthier. It also did not affect how long babies stayed in the hospital, if they died, or how much they weighed when they left the hospital. However, babies who got glycerin laxatives were less likely to have problems pooping in the first two days.  All the studies we looked at said there were no side effects.	This study looked at whether giving glycerin laxatives to premature babies to prevent feeding intolerance was helpful. They found that giving glycerin laxatives to premature babies did not reduce the time it took for them to get full feeds and did not affect other outcomes like how long they stayed in the hospital, how many died, or how much weight they gained after leaving the hospital. Giving glycerin laxatives to premature babies didn't cause fewer babies to pass stool over the first 48 hours. The studies they looked at didn't report any side effects.
56	We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models based on available-participant analysis with Review Manager. We assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis using Stata, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

57	We included cohort studies that examined the accuracy of BAL galactomannan for the diagnosis of IA in immunocompromised patients if they used the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) classification as reference standard.	We looked at studies that examined the accuracy of the galactomannan test when used to diagnose IA in people with weakened immune systems. The studies used the EORTC/MSG classification as the standard way to determine if someone had IA.	We included studies that looked at the accuracy of BAL galactomannan for diagnosing IA in patients with weakened immune systems.

58	Bisphophonates are commonly prescribed to individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta. Current evidence, albeit limited, demonstrates oral or intravenous bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density in children and adults with this condition. These were not shown to be different in their ability to increase bone mineral density. It is unclear whether oral or intravenous bisphosphonate treatment consistently decreases fractures, though multiple studies report this independently and no studies report an increased fracture rate with treatment. The studies included here do not show bisphosphonates conclusively improve clinical status (reduce pain; improve growth and functional mobility) in people with osteogenesis imperfecta. Given their current widespread and expected continued use, the optimal method, duration of therapy and long-term safety of bisphosphonate therapy require further investigation. In addition, attention should be given to long-term fracture reduction and improvement in quality of life indicators.	Bisphosphonates are a common treatment for people with osteogenesis imperfecta, a condition that makes bones weak and brittle. While there is limited research, existing studies show that both oral and intravenous bisphosphonates can increase bone density in children and adults with osteogenesis imperfecta. The studies do not show a clear difference between oral and intravenous bisphosphonates in their ability to increase bone density. It is not clear whether bisphosphonates consistently reduce fractures, although several studies report this independently.  No studies have shown an increase in fracture rates with bisphosphonate treatment. The studies do not conclusively demonstrate that bisphosphonates improve clinical status (reduce pain; improve growth and functional mobility) in people with osteogenesis imperfecta.  Considering the widespread use of bisphosphonates, more research is needed to determine the optimal method, duration of therapy, and long-term safety. It is also important to focus on long-term fracture reduction and improvement in quality of life.	Bisphophonates are often prescribed to people with osteogenesis imperfecta, a condition where bones become weaker. Studies have shown that oral or intravenous bisphosphonates can increase bone density in children and adults with this condition. However, these studies haven't shown any difference in their ability to increase bone density. It's unclear whether oral or intravenous bisphosphonates consistently reduce fractures, though multiple studies report this independently and no studies report an increase in fracture rates with treatment. The studies we included here don't show that bisphosphonates significantly improve clinical status (reduce pain, improve growth and functional mobility) in people with osteogenesis imperfecta. Given their widespread and expected continued use, the best method, duration of treatment, and long-term safety of bisphosphonate therapy need further investigation. Additionally, we should focus on long-term fracture reduction and improvement in quality of life indicators.
59	There are various reasons why weaning and extubation failure occur, but ineffective cough and secretion retention can play a significant role. Cough augmentation techniques, such as lung volume recruitment or manually- and mechanically-assisted cough, are used to prevent and manage respiratory complications associated with chronic conditions, particularly neuromuscular disease, and may improve short- and long-term outcomes for people with acute respiratory failure. However, the role of cough augmentation to facilitate extubation and prevent post-extubation respiratory failure is unclear.	There are many reasons why people have trouble breathing on their own after being on a ventilator, but a weak cough and mucus buildup can be a big problem. Coughing techniques, like lung volume recruitment or manually and mechanically-assisted coughing, are used to help prevent and manage breathing problems caused by chronic illnesses, especially muscle disorders. These techniques may help people with acute respiratory failure get better faster and in the long run. However, it is not clear whether these coughing techniques can help people come off the ventilator and prevent breathing problems after they come off the ventilator.	There are many reasons why people don't get better after weaning and extubation, but it's important to remember that coughing and secretion retention can be a big problem. Cough augmentation techniques, such as lung volume recruitment or manually- and mechanically-assisted cough, are used to prevent and manage respiratory complications related to long-term conditions, especially neuromuscular diseases, and may improve short-term and long-term outcomes for people with acute respiratory failure. However, it's not clear if cough augmentation can help people get extubation and prevent respiratory failure after extubation.
60	Along with 26 studies included in the 2013 Cochrane Review, we added 26 studies for this update, resulting in 52 studies involving 21,086 participants for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Follow-up periods ranged between 3 and 48 months and were classified as short-term (up to 6 months), medium-term (6 to 15 months), and long-term (longer than 15 months) follow-up. Studies were conducted in 19 different countries. The mean age of included participants was 67 years, and 66% were male. Participants were treated in all types of healthcare settings, including primary (n =15), secondary (n = 22), and tertiary care (n = 5), and combined primary and secondary care (n = 10). Overall, the level of certainty of evidence was moderate to high. We found that IDM probably improves health-related QoL as measured by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at medium-term follow-up (mean difference (MD) -3.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.16 to -1.63; 18 RCTs, 4321 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). A comparable effect was observed at short-term follow-up (MD -3.78, 95% CI -6.29 to -1.28; 16 RCTs, 1788 participants). However, the common effect did not exceed the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 4 points. There was no significant difference between IDM and control for long-term follow-up and for generic QoL. IDM probably also leads to a large improvement in maximum and functional exercise capacity, as measured by six-minute walking distance (6MWD), at medium-term follow-up (MD 44.69, 95% CI 24.01 to 65.37; 13 studies, 2071 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The effect exceeded the MCID of 35 metres and was even greater at short-term (MD 52.26, 95% CI 32.39 to 72.74; 17 RCTs, 1390 participants) and long-term (MD 48.83, 95% CI 16.37 to 80.49; 6 RCTs, 7288 participants) follow-up. The number of participants with respiratory-related admissions was reduced from 324 per 1000 participants in the control group to 235 per 1000 participants in the IDM group (odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.81; 15 RCTs, median follow-up 12 months, 4207 participants; high-certainty evidence). Likewise, IDM probably results in a reduction in emergency department (ED) visits (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.50 to 0.93; 9 RCTs, median follow-up 12 months, 8791 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), a slight reduction in all-cause hospital admissions (OR 0.75, 95%CI 0.57 to 0.98; 10 RCTs, median follow-up 12 months, 9030 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and fewer hospital days per person admitted (MD -2.27, 95% CI -3.98 to -0.56; 14 RCTs, median follow-up 12 months, 3563 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Statistically significant improvement was noted on the Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnoea Scale at short- and medium-term follow-up but not at long-term follow-up. No differences between groups were reported for mortality, courses of antibiotics/prednisolone, dyspnoea, and depression and anxiety scores. Subgroup analysis of dominant intervention components and regions of study suggested context- and intervention-specific effects. However, some subgroup analyses were marked by considerable heterogeneity or included few studies. These results should therefore be interpreted with caution.	This research looked at the effects of a treatment called IDM on people with breathing problems.  The researchers combined data from 52 studies involving over 21,000 people. They followed these people for different lengths of time, from a few months to four years. The studies were done in many different countries, and the participants were of all ages and genders. Overall, the evidence suggests that IDM probably improves quality of life for people with breathing problems, especially in the medium term (6 to 15 months). IDM also seems to help people walk further and exercise more easily.  People who received IDM were less likely to need to be hospitalized for breathing problems, go to the emergency room, or need to stay in the hospital for a long time. However, there was no clear difference between IDM and standard care in terms of how long people lived or how many people experienced other health problems.	"This study looked at whether a type of exercise called ""IDM"" helps people with lung problems breathe better. The study included 21,086 people from 19 different countries. The study found that IDM probably helps people with lung problems breathe better, especially in the short term. It also seems to help people exercise more, especially in the short term. The study also found that IDM probably helps people with lung problems breathe better."
61	Three studies with 318 participants met the inclusion criteria, 189 undergoing the percutaneous technique and 129 treated by cut-down femoral artery access. One study had a small sample size and did not adequately report the method of randomisation, allocation concealment or preselected outcomes. The other two larger studies had few sources of bias and good methodology; although one study had a high risk of bias in selective reporting. We observed no clear difference in short-term mortality between groups, with only one death occurring overall, in the totally percutaneous group (risk ratio (RR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 36.18; 2 studies, 181 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study reported failure of aneurysm exclusion. There was one failure of aneurysm exclusion in the surgical cut-down femoral artery access group (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.02; 1 study, 151 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For wound infection, there was no clear difference between groups (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.59; 3 studies, 318 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference between percutaneous and cut-down femoral artery access groups in major complications (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.41; 3 studies, 318 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), bleeding complications (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.29 to 3.64; 2 studies, 181 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or haematoma (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.13 to 6.05; 2 studies, 288 participants). One study reported medium- to long-term complications at six months, with no clear differences between the percutaneous and cut-down femoral artery access groups (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.65; 1 study, 135 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We detected differences in operating time, with the percutaneous approach being faster than cut-down femoral artery access (mean difference (MD) -21.13 minutes, 95% CI -41.74 to -0.53 minutes; 3 studies, 318 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study reported the duration of ITU stay and hospital stay, with no clear difference between groups.	"We reviewed three studies that looked at two different ways to access the femoral artery during a procedure to fix a weakened blood vessel (aneurysm).  One method is called the ""percutaneous technique"" where a needle is used to access the artery through the skin. The other method is called ""cut-down femoral artery access"" where a small incision is made in the skin to reach the artery. We found that there was no clear difference in the number of people who died shortly after the procedure between the two groups. There was also no clear difference in the number of people who had infections, major complications, bleeding, or blood clots after the procedure. The percutaneous approach was faster than the cut-down approach, but there was no clear difference in how long people stayed in the intensive care unit or the hospital. Overall, the evidence suggests that there is no clear difference in safety or effectiveness between the two methods. However, more studies are needed to confirm these findings, especially since some of the studies were small and had some limitations."	This study looked at two types of surgery: percutaneous and cut-down femoral artery access. The study found that there wasn't a clear difference in the number of people who died in the short term between the two methods. The percutaneous approach was faster than cut-down femoral artery access in terms of complications, bleeding, or hemorrhage. The study also found that there wasn't a clear difference in the length of hospital stay between the two methods.
62	The use of anticholinergic drugs by people with overactive bladder syndrome results in important but modest improvements in symptoms compared with placebo treatment. In addition, recent studies suggest that this is generally associated with only modest improvement in quality of life. Adverse effects were higher with all anticholinergics compared with placebo. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were also higher for all anticholinergics except tolterodine. It is not known whether any benefits of anticholinergics are sustained during long-term treatment or after treatment stops.	Medications called anticholinergics, used for overactive bladder, can help people feel better but the improvement is small. Studies have shown that these medications may only slightly improve people's quality of life. However, they can also cause more side effects compared to not taking any medication.  Only one of these medications, tolterodine, seems to have fewer side effects.  It's not clear whether these medications continue to work for a long time or if they still work after people stop taking them.	People with overactive bladder syndrome are taking medicine called anticholinergics to treat their symptoms. These medicines can help reduce symptoms, but they don't make much difference compared to a placebo (a fake treatment). Recent studies have shown that these medicines can only slightly improve quality of life. People who took anticholinergics had more side effects than those who took a placebo. People who stopped taking anticholinergics were also more likely to have side effects. We don't know if the benefits of anticholinergics last for a long time or after treatment stops.
63	Inhaled beta-agonist therapy is central to the management of acute asthma. The use of intravenous beta-agonist agents may also be beneficial in this setting. To determine the benefit of intravenous (IV) beta2-agonists for severe acute asthma treated in the emergency department. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Register which is a compilation of systematic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL as well as hand searching of 20 respiratory journals. Bibliographies from included studies and known reviews were also searched. Primary authors and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. Only RCTs were considered for inclusion. Studies were included if patients presented to the emergency department with acute asthma and were treated with IV selective or nonselective beta2-agonists versus placebo, inhaled beta2-agonists, or other standard of care. Pulmonary function, vital signs, arterial gasses, adverse effects, and/or clinical success could be reported as outcome measures. Two reviewers independently selected potentially relevant articles and selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed using two scoring systems and two reviewers. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers, and confirmed with corresponding authors. Missing data were obtained from authors or calculated from data present in the papers. Trials were combined using a random effects model for odds ratios (OR) or weighted mean differences (WMD) and reported with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). From 746 identified references, 55 potentially relevant articles were identified and 15 were included. The trials included 584 patients. Overall, selective IV beta2-agonist use conferred no advantage over the comparator regimes. For example, it was associated with a lower PEFR after 60 minutes compared to inhaled beta2-agonist, although the difference was not statistically significant (-24.7 l/min; 95%CI 2.9, -52.3). There was no difference in heart rate (4.5 bpm; 95% CI -4.9, 14.0). In the well performed blinded studies there was no difference in autonomic side effects between treatments (Odds Ratio 2.2 (95%CI 0.9, 5.7). There is no evidence to support the use of IV beta2-agonists in patients with severe acute asthma. These drugs should be given by inhalation. No subgroups were identified in which the IV route should be considered.	This study looked at whether giving beta-agonist medication through an IV (intravenous, meaning directly into the vein) helps people with severe asthma attacks in the emergency room.  They compared this to giving the medication by inhaler, which is the usual way. They found that giving beta-agonist through the IV didn't help people recover any faster or better than using an inhaler. It actually might even be worse in some cases, but the difference wasn't significant.  So, the conclusion is that there's no good reason to use an IV for severe asthma attacks.  The inhaler works just as well and is much easier to use.	This study looked at whether giving beta-agonists through a vein (intravenous) to people with severe asthma in the emergency room is helpful. Beta-agonists are medicines that help the body breathe better. The study found that giving beta-agonists through a vein doesn't seem to improve asthma symptoms. For example, giving beta-agonists through a vein might lead to a lower breathing rate, but this difference wasn't statistically significant. The study also found that giving beta-agonists through a vein didn't seem to cause any side effects. Overall, there's no evidence to support giving beta-agonists through a vein for people with severe asthma. These medications should only be given through a vein.

66	Two RCTs conducted in an outpatient hospital setting were included (231 adult participants, mean age 58.6 years, 60% female, 95% to 100% moderate to severe disease). Both studies compared a single injection of a non-selective NSAID (12.5 mg diclofenac or 15.0 mg ketorolac) given at lower than normal doses with a single injection of a glucocorticoid (triamcinolone 20 mg or 5 mg), with maximum follow-up duration of 12 weeks or 24 weeks. In both studies, we detected risk of attrition and performance bias. One study also had risk of selection bias. The effects of treatment were sensitive to assumptions about missing outcomes. All seven outcomes were reported in one study, and five in the other. NSAID injection may offer little to no benefit over glucocorticoid injection, based on low- to very low-certainty evidence from two trials. Evidence was downgraded for bias and imprecision. There may be little to no difference between groups in resolution of symptoms at 12 to 24 weeks (34% with NSAIDs, 41% with glucocorticoids; absolute effect 7% lower, 95% confidence interval (CI) 16% lower to 5% higher; 2 studies, 231 participants; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.11; low-certainty evidence). The rate of persistent moderate to severe symptoms may be higher at 12 to 24 weeks in the NSAIDs group (28%) compared to the glucocorticoid group (14%) (absolute effect 14% higher, 95% CI 2% to 33% higher; 2 studies, 231 participants; RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.46; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether NSAIDs result in fewer recurrences at 12 to 24 weeks (1%) compared to glucocorticoid (21%) (absolute effect 20% lower, 95% CI 21% to 13% lower; 2 studies, 231 participants; RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.38; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between groups in mean total active motion at 24 weeks (235 degrees with NSAIDs, 240 degrees with glucocorticoid) (absolute effect 5% lower, 95% CI 34.54% lower to 24.54% higher; 1 study, 99 participants; MD -5.00, 95% CI -34.54 to 24.54; low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between groups in residual pain at 12 to 24 weeks (20% with NSAIDs, 24% with glucocorticoid) (absolute effect 4% lower, 95% CI 11% lower to 7% higher; 2 studies, 231 participants; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.31; low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between groups in participant-reported treatment success at 24 weeks (64% with NSAIDs, 68% with glucocorticoid) (absolute effect 4% lower, 95% CI 18% lower to 15% higher; 1 study, 121 participants; RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.23; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether NSAID injection has an effect on adverse events at 12 to 24 weeks (1% with NSAIDs, 1% with glucocorticoid) (absolute effect 0% difference, 95% CI 2% lower to 3% higher; 2 studies, 231 participants; RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.42; very low-certainty evidence).	This study looked at two different types of injections for pain relief in people with moderate to severe pain. The injections were either a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like diclofenac or ketorolac, or a steroid called triamcinolone. The researchers wanted to see if one type of injection was better than the other. They found that both types of injections may have similar effects, but the evidence is not very strong. There might be a slight chance that NSAID injections might cause more persistent pain, but the evidence for that is also not very strong. They also found that NSAID injections might have fewer side effects, but the evidence for that is also very weak. Overall, there isn't enough evidence to say for sure whether one type of injection is better than the other.	This study looked at two different ways to treat a condition called moderate to severe diabetes. One way is to give a medicine called a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to people with moderate to severe diabetes. The other way is to give a medicine called a glucocorticoid (glucocorticoid) to people with moderate to severe diabetes. The study found that NSAIDs might not be as effective as glucocorticoids, but the evidence is weak. The study also found that NSAIDs might not be as effective as glucocorticoids, but more research is needed to be sure.

68	Visual problems in older people are common and frequently under-reported. The effects of poor vision in older people are wide reaching and include falls, confusion and reduced quality of life. Much of the visual impairment in older ages can be treated (e.g. cataract surgery, correction of refractive error). Vision screening may therefore reduce the number of older people living with sight loss.	Visual problems are common in older people, and often they don't tell anyone about them.  Poor vision can have serious consequences for older people, such as falls, confusion, and a lower quality of life.  Many vision problems in older people can be treated, for example, with cataract surgery or correction for refractive error.  So, vision screening may help reduce the number of older people living with sight loss.	Vision problems in older people are common and often not reported.

69	This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in October 2013 on'Sumatriptan plus naproxen for acute migraine attacks in adults'. Migraine is a common disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services, and society. It affects two to three times more women than men, and is most common in the age range 30 to 50 years. Effective abortive treatments include the triptan and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory classes of drugs. These drugs have different mechanisms of action and combining them may provide better relief. Sumatriptan plus naproxen is now available in combination form for the acute treatment of migraine.	This updated version of a previous review examines the use of Sumatriptan plus Naproxen for treating migraine headaches in adults. Migraine is a common and disabling condition that affects more women than men, usually between the ages of 30 and 50.  Common treatments include triptans and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Since these drugs work in different ways, combining them might provide better relief. Sumatriptan plus Naproxen is now available as a combined medication for treating migraine attacks.	Migraine is a common condition that can make it hard for people to move around. It's a big problem for people, healthcare providers, and society. It affects two to three times more women than men, and it's most common in people between 30 and 50 years old. There are two main types of migraine medicine: triptan and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These medicines work differently, so combining them might be better. Sumatriptan plus naproxen is now available in combination form for treating migraine attacks in adults.
70	In people with cataracts and generally mild to moderate OAG, there is moderate-certainty evidence that the Hydrus microstent with cataract surgery compared to cataract surgery alone, likely increases the proportion of participants who do not require IOP lowering medication, and may further reduce IOP at short- and medium-term follow-up. There is moderate-certainty evidence that the Hydrus microstent is probably more effective than the iStent in lowering IOP of people with OAG in the short-term. Few studies were available on the effects of the Hydrus microstent, therefore the results of this review may not be applicable to all people with OAG, particularly in selected people with medically uncontrolled glaucoma, since IOP was controlled with medication in many participants in the included studies. Complications may be rare using the Hydrus microstent, as well as the comparator iStent, but larger studies are needed to investigate its safety.	This review looked at the Hydrus microstent, a small tube placed during cataract surgery, for people with cataracts and a mild to moderate form of glaucoma (OAG). The Hydrus microstent likely helps more people avoid needing eye drops to lower eye pressure. It also seems to lower eye pressure better than a similar device (iStent) in the short term. However, there wasn't a lot of research on the Hydrus microstent, so these findings might not apply to everyone with OAG, especially those with severe glaucoma that doesn't respond well to eye drops. While the Hydrus microstent and iStent seem to be safe, more research is needed to confirm this.	This study looked at whether a special device called a Hydrus microstent can help people with glaucoma, a type of eye disease. The Hydrus microstent was found to be more effective than the iStent in lowering eye pressure in people with glaucoma. The study also found that the Hydrus microstent might be more effective than the iStent in lowering eye pressure in the short term. However, more research is needed to fully understand the safety of the Hydrus microstent.
71	Pre-eclampsia is a relatively common complication of pregnancy. HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome is a severe manifestation of pre-eclampsia with significant morbidity and mortality for pregnant women and their children. Corticosteroids are commonly used in the treatment of HELLP syndrome in the belief that they improve outcomes. To determine the effects of corticosteroids on women with HELLP syndrome and their children. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2010). Randomized controlled trials comparing any corticosteroid with placebo, no treatment, or other drug; or comparing one corticosteroid with another corticosteroid or dosage in women with HELLP syndrome. Two review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. Eleven trials (550 women) compared corticosteroids with placebo or no treatment. There was no difference in the risk of maternal death (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 3.21), maternal death or severe maternal morbidity (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.12), or perinatal/infant death (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.97). The only clear effect of treatment on individual outcomes was improved platelet count (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.67, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.10). The effect on platelet count was strongest for women who commenced treatment antenatally (SMD 0.80, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.35). Two trials (76 women) compared dexamethasone with betamethasone. There was no clear evidence of a difference between groups in respect to perinatal/infant death (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.17) or severe perinatal/infant morbidity or death (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.48). Maternal death and severe maternal morbidity were not reported. In respect to platelet count, dexamethasone was superior to betamethasone (MD 6.02, 95% CI 1.71 to 10.33), both when treatment was commenced antenatally (MD 8.10, 95% CI 6.23 to 9.97) and postnatally (MD 3.70, 95% CI 0.96 to 6.44). There was no clear evidence of any effect of corticosteroids on substantive clinical outcomes. Those receiving steroids showed significantly greater improvement in platelet counts which was greater for those receiving dexamethasone than those receiving betamethasone. There is to date insufficient evidence of benefits in terms of substantive clinical outcomes to support the routine use of steroids for the management of HELLP. The use of corticosteroids may be justified in clinical situations in which increased rate of recovery in platelet count is considered clinically worthwhile.	Pre-eclampsia is a common pregnancy problem. HELLP syndrome is a very serious form of pre-eclampsia that can be dangerous for both the mother and the baby. Doctors often give corticosteroids to women with HELLP syndrome because they think it might help them get better. We looked at studies to see if corticosteroids actually help women with HELLP syndrome and their babies. We found that corticosteroids didn't seem to make a big difference in how sick the mothers were or how healthy the babies were. However, corticosteroids did help increase the number of platelets in the mothers' blood. This effect was stronger for mothers who started taking corticosteroids before they gave birth. When comparing two different types of corticosteroids, dexamethasone seemed to work slightly better than betamethasone in increasing platelet counts. Overall, we don't have enough evidence to say that corticosteroids should be routinely used for women with HELLP syndrome. However, they may be helpful in cases where a faster increase in platelet count is important.	Pre-eclampsia is a common problem during pregnancy. It can lead to a serious condition called HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome. This condition can be very serious for both pregnant women and their children. Doctors often use steroids to treat HELLP syndrome because they think they can improve outcomes. We wanted to see if steroids helped women with HELLP syndrome and their children. We looked at many studies that compared steroids to a fake medicine (placebo) or no treatment.

72	In patients with heart failure low-quality evidence showed a reduction in heart failure admission with NP-guided treatment while low-quality evidence showed uncertainty in the effect of NP-guided treatment for all-cause mortality, heart failure mortality, and all-cause admission. Uncertainty in the effect was further shown by very low-quality evidence for patient's quality of life. The evidence for adverse events and cost of treatment was low quality and we were unable to pool results.	We found limited evidence that NP-guided treatment might help reduce the number of times people with heart failure are admitted to the hospital. However, we are unsure whether this treatment affects the risk of death from any cause, death from heart failure, or the number of times people are admitted to the hospital for any reason.  We found very limited evidence about the effect of this treatment on quality of life.  We also found limited evidence about side effects and cost of treatment, and we couldn't combine the results.	This study looked at a treatment called NP-guided treatment for people with heart failure. The study found that NP-guided treatment reduced the number of times people with heart failure needed to go to the hospital for treatment. However, the study also found that there wasn't enough good evidence to say for sure if NP-guided treatment helped people with all-cause mortality, heart failure mortality, or all-cause admission. The study also found that there wasn't enough good evidence to say for sure if NP-guided treatment helped people with all-cause mortality, heart failure mortality, or all-cause admission. The study also found that there wasn't enough good evidence to say for sure if NP-guided treatment helped people with all-cause mortality, heart failure mortality, or all-cause admission. The study also found that there wasn't enough good evidence to say for sure if NP-guided treatment helped people with all-cause mortality, all-cause mortality, and all-cause admission. The study also found that there wasn't enough good evidence to say for sure if NP-guided treatment helped people with all-cause mortality, all-cause mortality, and all-cause admission. The evidence for side effects and cost of treatment was low quality, so we couldn't combine the results.
73	This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2005, Issue 4 (and last updated in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2013 issue 8), on local anaesthetic blockade (LASB) of the sympathetic chain to treat people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).	This review updates a previous review published in 2005 and last updated in 2013. The review focuses on a treatment for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) called local anesthetic blockade of the sympathetic chain (LASB).	This review is an update of a previous review on local anesthetic blockade (LASB) of the sympathetic chain to treat people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).
74	Overall, there were significant methodological limitations across the trials included in this review. Given the moderate or very low quality of the available evidence, there is only uncertain evidence regarding a number of psychosocial interventions for adults who engage in SH. Psychosocial therapy based on CBT approaches may result in fewer individuals repeating SH at longer follow-up time points, although no such effect was found at the post-intervention assessment and the quality of evidence, according to the GRADE criteria, was low. Given findings in single trials, or trials by the same author group, both MBT and group-based emotion regulation therapy should be further developed and evaluated in adults. DBT may also lead to a reduction in frequency of SH. Other interventions were mostly evaluated in single trials of moderate to very low quality such that the evidence relating to the use of these interventions is inconclusive at present.	Overall, the studies we looked at had some problems with how they were designed. Because the quality of the evidence is not very good, we're not completely sure if many psychosocial interventions work for adults who self-harm. Therapy based on CBT approaches might help fewer people repeat self-harm at longer follow-up times, but we didn't see that effect at the end of treatment and the quality of the evidence is low. Based on single studies or studies by the same group of researchers, both MBT and group-based emotion regulation therapy should be studied more in adults. DBT might also help reduce the frequency of self-harm. Other interventions were mostly studied in single studies of moderate to very low quality, so the evidence about these interventions is not clear right now.	This review looked at different types of therapy for adults who have trouble managing their emotions. The studies we looked at had some problems with how they were done. For example, one type of therapy, called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), might make it harder for people to repeat the same behavior over a longer period of time. However, we don't know for sure if CBT helps people repeat the same behavior over a longer period of time. We need more research to see if MBT and group-based emotion regulation therapy are helpful for adults who have trouble managing their emotions. We also need more research to see if DBT can help reduce the number of times people repeat the same behavior. Most of the studies we looked at were of moderate to very low quality, so we don't have enough information to say for sure if these interventions are helpful.
75	We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Our primary outcome measure was nasopharyngeal cancer-specific mortality. Secondary outcomes were incidence of nasopharyngeal cancer by stage and histopathological classification at diagnosis, survival (two-year, three-year, five-year and 10-year), harms of screening (physical and psychosocial), quality of life (via validated tools such as the SF-36 and patient satisfaction), cost-effectiveness and all-cause mortality.	We followed the standard scientific methods used by The Cochrane Collaboration. Our main goal was to see if the screening program reduced the number of deaths from nasopharyngeal cancer. We also looked at how often nasopharyngeal cancer was diagnosed at different stages, how well people lived after being diagnosed, if the screening program caused any harm, how good people's quality of life was, how cost-effective the program was, and how many people died from any cause.	We followed standard research methods used by The Cochrane Collaboration. Our main goal was to see how many people died from nasopharyngeal cancer, which is a type of cancer that affects the throat. We also looked at how many people died from nasopharyngeal cancer, how long they lived (two years, three years, five years, and 10 years), the risks of screening (physical and mental), their quality of life (using tools like the SF-36 and patient satisfaction), how cost-effective screening is, and how many people died from all causes.
76	The available evidence suggests that prophylaxis with palivizumab reduces hospitalisation due to RSV infection and results in little to no difference in mortality or adverse events. Moreover, palivizumab results in a slight reduction in hospitalisation due to respiratory-related illness and may result in a large reduction in RSV infections. Palivizumab also reduces the number of wheezing days. These results may be applicable to children with a high risk of RSV infection due to comorbidities. Further research is needed to establish the effect of palivizumab on children with other comorbidities known as risk factors for severe RSV disease (e.g. immune deficiencies) and other social determinants of the disease, including children living in low- and middle-income countries, tropical regions, children lacking breastfeeding, living in poverty, or members of families in overcrowded situations.	Palivizumab is a medicine that can help prevent serious respiratory illnesses in babies and young children. Studies show that it reduces hospitalizations due to RSV infection, a common respiratory virus, and doesn't seem to cause any major side effects.  It also reduces the number of times children have wheezing. These findings might be relevant for children who are at a higher risk of getting sick with RSV due to other health conditions. However, more research is needed to understand how effective palivizumab is in children with other health issues and in different parts of the world, like low- and middle-income countries.	This study looked at whether a medicine called palivizumab can help prevent RSV infection in children. It found that palivizumab can help reduce hospital stays for RSV infections, but it doesn't seem to make a big difference in how many people die or have side effects. Palivizumab also helps reduce hospital stays for respiratory-related illnesses and may also reduce the number of RSV infections. Palivizumab also helps reduce the number of wheezing days. These findings could be helpful for children at high risk of RSV infection due to other health problems. More research is needed to understand how palivizumab affects children with other health problems, such as those living in low- and middle-income countries, tropical regions, children lacking breastfeeding, poverty, or members of families in overcrowded situations.
77	We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. At least two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcome of the review was reading speed in words per minute. Secondary outcomes included reading duration and acuity, ease and frequency of use, quality of life and adverse outcomes. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.	We followed standard methods used by Cochrane. Two different people looked at the studies to decide how good they were and took out important information. The main thing we looked at was how fast people could read in words per minute. Other things we looked at were how long it took to read, how well people could see, how easy the tools were to use, and if people had any side effects. We used a system called GRADE to say how sure we are about the evidence.	We used standard methods to conduct this review. At least two authors independently assessed the quality of the studies and extracted data. The main outcome we were interested in was reading speed in words per minute. We also looked at other outcomes like reading duration and acuity, ease and frequency of use, quality of life, and side effects. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.
78	Anaphylaxis is a serious hypersensitivity reaction that is rapid in onset and may result in death. Anaphylaxis guidelines recommend glucocorticoids for the treatment of people experiencing anaphylaxis. We sought to assess the benefits and harms of glucocorticoid treatment during episodes of anaphylaxis. In our previous version we searched the literature until September 2009. In this version we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid) (1956 to September 2011), EMBASE (Ovid) (1982 to September 2011), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (to September 2011). We also searched the UK National Research Register and websites listing ongoing trials, and contacted international experts in anaphylaxis in an attempt to locate unpublished material. We planned to include randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing glucocorticoids with any control (either placebo, adrenaline (epinephrine), an antihistamine, or any combination of these). Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion. We found no studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. We are, based on this review, unable to make any recommendations for the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of anaphylaxis.	Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening.  It happens quickly and can make you very sick.  Guidelines for treating anaphylaxis recommend using a type of medicine called glucocorticoids. We wanted to see if using glucocorticoids was helpful and safe for people with anaphylaxis.  We looked at all the studies that compared glucocorticoids with other treatments for anaphylaxis, but we didn't find any studies that met our criteria. So, based on the research we have, we cannot make any recommendations about using glucocorticoids for anaphylaxis.	Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that can happen quickly and even lead to death. Doctors recommend using a medicine called glucocorticoids to treat anaphylaxis. We wanted to find out if glucocorticoids are safe and effective for treating anaphylaxis. We looked at many studies, but we couldn't find any that met our criteria. So, we can't recommend using glucocorticoids for anaphylaxis.
79	We included 11 trials with 699 participants. Ten trials provided data for analysis. Trials varied in the numbers and types of participants included and in the types of surgery performed. Most trials were at high or unclear risk of bias because of inappropriate or unclear randomization procedures, and because blinding of assessors and participants generally was not possible. This may have influenced results, but it is unclear how the results may have been influenced. Active warming was found to reduce the mean time taken to achieve normothermia by about 30 minutes in comparison with use of warmed cotton blankets (mean difference (MD) -32.13 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -42.55 to -21.71; moderate-quality evidence), but no significant difference in shivering was noted. Active warming was found to reduce mean time taken to achieve normothermia by almost an hour and a half in comparison with use of unwarmed cotton blankets (MD -88.86 minutes, 95% CI -123.49 to -54.23; moderate-quality evidence), and people in the active warming group were less likely to shiver than those in the unwarmed cotton blanket group (Relative Risk=0.61 95% CI= 0.42 to 0.86; low quality evidence). There was no effect on mean temperature difference in degrees celsius at 60 minutes (MD=0.18degC, 95% CI=-0.10 to 0.46; moderate quality evidence), and no data were available in relation to major cardiovascular complications. Forced air warming was found to reduce time taken to achieve normothermia by about one hour in comparison to circulating hot water devices (MD=-54.21 minutes 95% CI= -94.95, -13.47). There was no statistically significant difference between thermal insulation and cotton blankets on mean time to achieve normothermia (MD =-0.29 minutes, 95% CI=-25.47 to 24.89; moderate quality evidence) or shivering (Relative Risk=1.36 95% CI= 0.69 to 2.67; moderate quality evidence), and no data were available for mean temperature difference or major cardiovascular complications. Insufficient evidence was available about other comparisons, adverse effects or any other secondary outcomes.	This study looked at 11 different studies involving 699 people who had surgery. The goal was to see if warming people up after surgery helps them recover faster.  Most of the studies had some problems with how they were designed, so the results might not be completely accurate.  The studies found that using active warming methods, like warm air blankets, helped people reach normal body temperature about 30 minutes faster than using regular blankets. Active warming also seemed to help people shiver less than those who used regular blankets. However, the study didnâ€™t find any evidence that active warming helped people get warmer overall or prevented serious health problems.  The study also found that using forced air warming was faster than using hot water devices to warm people up.  The study didnâ€™t find any difference in how fast people warmed up using thermal insulation compared to regular blankets.  Overall, the study suggests that active warming may be helpful after surgery, but more research is needed to be sure.	This study looked at 11 different research projects involving 699 people who had heart surgery. The researchers wanted to see if using warm blankets (active warming) could help people get back to their normal temperature by about 30 minutes compared to using warm cotton blankets (unwarmed). They also found that people who used active warming were less likely to shiver than those who used unwarmed cotton blankets. They also found that using forced air warming helped people get back to their normal temperature by about one hour compared to using circulating hot water devices. There was no significant difference between thermal insulation and cotton blankets in terms of how long it took to get back to normal temperature or shivering. They didn't have enough information about other comparisons, side effects, or other outcomes.
80	Two review authors independently screened trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2) and Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) guidelines. We used a random-effects model to meta-analyse data, producing risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes in trials with individual allocation, adjusted RRs for dichotomous outcomes in trials with cluster allocation (using the generic inverse variance method in Review Manager 5), and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.	Two different researchers looked at the trials included in this study. They checked the trials to make sure they were done correctly. They used a tool called the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2) to do this. They then combined the results of the different trials into one set of results. They used a method called a random-effects model to do this. This method is used when the trials are looking at different things. They also used a method called the GRADE approach to assess how certain they were about their results.	Two researchers independently looked at the studies, extracted data, and assessed how reliable the studies were using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2) and Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) guidelines. We used a random-effects model to combine the results of the studies, calculating risk ratios (RRs) for outcomes that were not clear-cut, adjusted RRs for outcomes that were not clear-cut, and mean differences (MDs) for outcomes that were continuous. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.
81	The use of mechanical thrombectomy to restore intracranial blood flow after proximal large artery occlusion by a thrombus has increased over time and led to better outcomes than intravenous thrombolytic therapy alone. Currently, the type of anaesthetic technique during mechanical thrombectomy is under debate as having a relevant impact on neurological outcomes.	Doctors are now using a device called a mechanical thrombectomy to remove blood clots from the brain after a stroke. This procedure has led to better outcomes than simply giving medicine through a vein. However, there's a debate about the best type of anesthesia to use during this procedure, as it might affect how well the patient recovers.	Doctors are increasingly using a technique called mechanical thrombectomy to restore blood flow to the brain after a large artery blockage caused by a thrombus. This technique has become more common and has led to better outcomes than just using blood thinners through a vein. However, the type of anesthetic used during mechanical thrombectomy is being debated as having a significant impact on brain function.
82	There was no conclusive evidence supporting any antenatal BF education for improving initiation of BF, proportion of women giving any BF or exclusively BF at three or six months or the duration of BF. There is an urgent need to conduct a high-quality, randomised controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of antenatal BF education, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Evidence in this review is primarily relevant to high-income settings.	We didn't find any solid evidence that giving breastfeeding advice before childbirth helps mothers start breastfeeding, breastfeed for any amount of time, or breastfeed exclusively for three or six months.  More research is urgently needed, especially in low- and middle-income countries, to see if breastfeeding advice before childbirth is helpful and if it has any negative effects. The evidence we reviewed is mostly relevant to high-income settings.	This study looked at whether teaching pregnant women about prenatal pregnancies (BF) can help them start pregnancies sooner, increase the number of women giving pregnancies, or make their pregnancies last longer. The study found that there is no strong evidence that teaching pregnancies about pregnancies helps women start pregnancies earlier, increase the number of women giving pregnancies, or improve the length of pregnancies. We urgently need to conduct a high-quality study to see if teaching pregnancies about pregnancies is effective and if it has any negative effects, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The evidence in this review is mainly relevant to high-income countries.
83	More than 400,000 cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) are diagnosed every year worldwide and this is rising. Much of the increase has been attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV-positive OPSCC patients are often younger and have significantly improved survival relative to HPV-negative patients. Traditional management of OPSCC has been with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, as this was shown to have similar survival to open surgery but with significantly lower morbidity. Techniques have evolved, however, with the development of computerised planning and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and of minimally invasive surgical techniques. Acute and late toxicities associated with chemoradiotherapy are a significant burden for OPSCC patients and with an ever-younger cohort, any strategies that could decrease treatment-associated morbidity should be investigated.	Throat cancer, specifically a type called oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC), is being diagnosed more and more frequently. This increase is linked to the human papillomavirus (HPV). People with HPV-positive throat cancer are often younger and have a better chance of surviving compared to those without HPV. Traditionally, throat cancer has been treated with radiation therapy, sometimes with chemotherapy. This approach has been shown to be as effective as surgery but with fewer side effects.  However, with advancements in technology, there are now more precise forms of radiation therapy and less invasive surgical techniques.  Radiation and chemotherapy treatments can cause side effects, both during and after treatment.  Since younger people are increasingly affected, we need to explore ways to reduce these side effects.	More and more people are being diagnosed with oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) every year around the world. Many of these cases are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). People with HPV-positive OPSCC are often younger and live longer than those with HPV-negative OPSCC. Traditional treatment for OPSCC has been with radiation therapy, with or without chemotherapy, as this has been shown to have similar survival rates as open surgery but with fewer side effects. However, new techniques have evolved with the development of computer-based planning and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and minimally invasive surgical techniques. The acute and late side effects of chemoradiotherapy are a significant burden for OPSCC patients and with an ever-younger cohort, any strategies to reduce treatment-associated side effects should be investigated.
84	Our results suggest that non-exergames may have a less beneficial effect on cognitive functioning than cognitive remediation, but have comparable effects for all other outcomes. These data are from a small number of trials, and the evidence is graded as of low or very low quality and is very likely to change with more data. It is difficult to currently establish if the more sophisticated cognitive approaches do any more good - or harm - than'static' video games for people with schizophrenia. Where players use bodily movements to control the game (exergames), there is very limited evidence suggesting a possible benefit of exergames compared to standard care in terms of cognitive functioning and aerobic fitness. However, this finding must be replicated in trials with a larger sample size and that are conducted over a longer time frame. We cannot draw any firm conclusions regarding the effects of video games until more high-quality evidence is available. There are ongoing studies that may provide helpful data in the near future.	We are studying the effects of video games on people with schizophrenia. We found that video games that don't require movement might not be as helpful as therapy designed to improve thinking skills. However, both types of video games seem to have similar effects on other aspects of the disease.  We need more research to be sure, but it's possible that video games are not a better treatment option than standard care.  Video games that use physical movement might help people with schizophrenia improve their thinking skills and physical fitness, but we need more studies to confirm this.  It's important to note that all of our findings are based on a small number of studies and need to be validated with more research.	This study looked at whether video games can help people with schizophrenia who are struggling with mental health issues. They found that games that don't involve physical movements might have a less positive impact on thinking skills than games that help people with mental health problems. However, they have similar effects on all other things. The study was done on a small number of people, and the quality of the evidence is low or very low. It's hard to say for sure if video games are better or worse than standard care for people with schizophrenia. There's not enough evidence to say for sure if video games actually help people with schizophrenia. Games where people use their bodies to control the game (exergames) might be better than standard care in terms of mental health and fitness. However, more research is needed to confirm this finding. We can't draw any firm conclusions about the effects of video games until more high-quality evidence is available. There are ongoing studies that could provide useful information in the near future.
85	First generation'typical' antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been the mainstay of treatment up until the introduction of the second generation'atypical' antipsychotics such as risperidone and olanzapine. Typical and atypical antipsychotics do provide a treatment response for most people with schizophrenia, whether a reduction in psychotic episodes or a lessening in the severity of their illness. However, a proportion of people still do not respond adequately to antipsychotic medication. Additionally, atypical and especially typical antipsychotics are associated with serious adverse effects, which can often compromise compliance with medication and therefore increase the incidences of relapse. In this review we examine the effects of aripiprazole compared with placebo. To evaluate the effects of aripiprazole compared with placebo for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses. We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (January 2008) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. For this update, we carried out an initial search in May 2007 and a second search in August 2008. We included all randomised trials comparing aripiprazole with placebo in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis. We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a fixed-effect model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) again based on a fixed-effect model. Despite the fact that 2585 people participated in nine randomised aripiprazole studies, we were unable to extract any usable data on death, service outcomes, general functioning, behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment; economic outcomes or cognitive functioning. In general, study attrition was very large for all studies over four weeks' duration. There was high attrition in most of the included studies. Fewer people left the aripiprazole group compared with those in the placebo group (n = 2585, 9 RCTs, RR 0.73 CI 0.60 to 0.87). Compared with placebo, aripiprazole significantly decreased relapse in both the short (n = 310, 1 RCT, RR 0.59 CI 0.45 to 0.77) and medium term (n = 310, 1 RCT, RR 0.66 CI 0.53 to 0.81). It also produced better compliance with study protocol (n = 2275, 8 RCTs, RR 0.74 CI 0.59 to 0.93). Aripiprazole may decrease prolactin levels below those expected from placebo (n = 305, 2 RCT, RR 0.21 CI 0.11 to 0.37). Insomnia (~23%) and headaches (~15%) were commonly reported in both groups, with no significant difference. Aripiprazole may be effective for the treatment of schizophrenia. Aripiprazole has a lower risk of raised prolactin and prolongation of the QTc interval. Clearly reported pragmatic short-, medium- and long-term randomised controlled trials should be undertaken to determine its position in everyday clinical practice.	Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how people think, feel, and behave.  There are different types of medication used to treat schizophrenia, but some people don't respond well to these medications. One of these medications is called aripiprazole. This review looks at how aripiprazole compares to a placebo (a fake pill) for treating schizophrenia.  Researchers reviewed a number of studies that involved over 2,500 people with schizophrenia. They found that aripiprazole was more effective than a placebo in reducing the risk of relapse (when symptoms return) in the short and medium term.  Aripiprazole also helped people stay on track with their treatment plan.  It also seems to lower prolactin levels, a hormone that can be affected by some schizophrenia medications.  Some common side effects of aripiprazole were insomnia (trouble sleeping) and headaches.  While aripiprazole shows promise, more research is needed to understand its place in everyday treatment.	This study looked at the effects of a medicine called aripiprazole compared to a fake medicine (placebo) for people with schizophrenia. Aripiprazole is a type of antipsychotic medicine that has been used for a long time to treat schizophrenia. The researchers wanted to see if aripiprazole was better than a placebo (a fake medicine). They searched for studies that compared aripiprazole to a placebo (a fake medicine). They found 9 studies that compared aripiprazole to a placebo in people with schizophrenia. They found that aripiprazole was better than a placebo in reducing the number of psychotic episodes or reducing the severity of schizophrenia. However, a few people still don't respond well to aripiprazole. They also found that aripiprazole can have serious side effects, which can make it harder for people to take their medication and lead to relapses. This review looked at the effects of aripiprazole compared to a placebo in people with schizophrenia.
86	We included 59 studies, including 214 to 169,485 participants, and 300 to 124, 644 households, mostly from Africa and Latin America, addressing the following six intervention types (three studies assessed two different types of interventions). Interventions that improved buying power: Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) (16 cRCTs, two RCTs, three PCSs): we found high-certainty evidence that UCTs improve food security and make little or no difference to cognitive function and development and low-certainty evidence that UCTs may increase dietary diversity and may reduce stunting. The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of UCTs on the proportion of household expenditure on food, and on wasting. Regarding adverse outcomes, evidence from one trial indicates that UCTs reduce the proportion of infants who are overweight. Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) (nine cRCTs, five PCSs): we found high-certainty evidence that CCTs result in little to no difference in the proportion of household expenditure on food and that they slightly improve cognitive function in children; moderate-certainty evidence that CCTs probably slightly improve dietary diversity and low-certainty evidence that they may make little to no difference to stunting or wasting. Evidence on adverse outcomes (two PCSs) shows that CCTs make no difference to the proportion of overweight children. Income generation interventions (six cRCTs, 11 PCSs): we found moderate-certainty evidence that income generation interventions probably make little or no difference to stunting or wasting; and low-certainty evidence that they may result in little to no difference to food security or that they may improve dietary diversity in children, but not for households. Interventions that addressed food prices: Food vouchers (three cRCTs, one RCT): we found moderate-certainty evidence that food vouchers probably reduce stunting; and low-certainty evidence that that they may improve dietary diversity slightly, and may result in little to no difference in wasting. Food and nutrition subsidies (one cRCT, three PCSs): we found low-certainty evidence that food and nutrition subsidies may improve dietary diversity among school children. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects on household expenditure on healthy foods as a proportion of total expenditure on food (very low-certainty evidence). Interventions that addressed the social environment: Social support interventions (one cRCT, one PCS): we found moderate-certainty evidence that community grants probably make little or no difference to wasting; low-certainty evidence that they may make little or no difference to stunting. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of village savings and loans on food security and dietary diversity. None of the included studies addressed the intervention category of infrastructure changes. In addition, none of the studies reported on one of the primary outcomes of this review, namely prevalence of undernourishment.	This study looked at 59 different ways to help people in Africa and Latin America get enough food and nutrition. The study focused on six different types of programs: giving money to families without any conditions, giving money to families with conditions, helping families earn more money, giving families food vouchers, providing food and nutrition subsidies, and helping families with social support. The study found that giving money to families without any conditions can help improve food security but doesn't have much effect on brain development. It may also help improve the variety of food people eat and reduce stunting, but the evidence on these effects is weak.  Giving money with conditions may help children's brain development slightly, but doesn't seem to affect how much families spend on food.  Helping families earn more money may help families get more food variety, but it doesn't seem to have much effect on stunting or wasting. Giving families food vouchers may help reduce stunting and improve dietary diversity slightly. Food and nutrition subsidies may help school children get more variety in their food.  Social support programs might help reduce wasting, but the evidence is weak. The study didn't look at the effects of infrastructure changes or the prevalence of undernourishment.	This study looked at different ways to help families in Africa and Latin America save money on food. They looked at six different types of interventions: unconditional cash transfers (UCTs), conditional cash transfers (CCTs), income generation interventions (CCTs), food vouchers, and food and nutrition subsidies. The study found that unconditional cash transfers don't seem to make a big difference in how much money families spend on food. However, they might slightly improve cognitive function and development. The study also found that conditional cash transfers might slightly increase dietary diversity and reduce stunting. The study also found that conditional cash transfers may slightly improve cognitive function in children, but the evidence is not very strong. The study also found that conditional cash transfers may slightly reduce stunting or wasting. The study also found that conditional cash transfers may slightly reduce stunting and wasting, but the evidence is not very strong. The study also found that conditional cash transfers may slightly improve dietary diversity in children, but the evidence is not very strong.
87	The management of sex offenders is a major public concern. Behavioural and pharmacological interventions have been used for many years and more recently cognitive behavioural based interventions have become popular around the world. Programmes designed for the general population have been modified for those sex offenders with learning disability, to address their cognitive deficits. The efficacy of these modified programmes is unclear. To determine the efficacy of interventions with learning disabled sex offenders. The reviewers searched the Cochrane Library 2006 (Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to Sept 2006), Embase (1980 to September 2006), CINAHL (1982 to September 2006), PsycINFO (1872 to September 2006), Biological Abstracts (1980 to September 2006). All randomised controlled trials comparing an intervention for learning disabled sex offenders to any other, or no intervention. Data were independently extracted. No randomised controlled trial was identified. Using the methods described the reviewers found no randomised controlled trial evidence to guide the use of interventions for learning disabled sex offenders. Until the urgent need for randomised controlled trials is met, clinical practice will continue to be guided by either extrapolation of evidence from randomised controlled trials involving sex offenders without learning disability or non-randomised trial evidence of interventions for the learning disabled sex offender.	It's a big concern for society how to deal with people who commit sexual offenses.  For a long time, we've used things like therapy and medication to help them. More recently, a type of therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy has become popular worldwide.  These therapies, originally designed for everyone, have been adapted to help sex offenders with learning disabilities by focusing on their specific challenges with thinking and learning. However, we don't know for sure if these adapted therapies are actually effective. To figure this out, researchers looked at studies where people with learning disabilities who committed sexual offenses were randomly assigned to different groups â€“ some received the therapy, some received a different treatment, and some didn't receive any treatment.  Unfortunately, they couldn't find any studies that met these criteria. So, for now, doctors and therapists have to rely on either applying knowledge from studies with sex offenders who don't have learning disabilities, or on studies about treatments for people with learning disabilities that aren't specifically designed for sexual offenses.  We really need more research to understand how to best help people with learning disabilities who commit sexual offenses.	This study looked at different ways to help people with learning disabilities who are sex offenders. The study found that there isn't enough evidence to say for sure if these new ways of helping sex offenders are effective. We need more research to see if these new ways of helping sex offenders are effective.
88	Oral vitamin B12 supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the risk of maternal vitamin B12 deficiency and may improve maternal vitamin B12 concentrations during pregnancy or postpartum compared to placebo or no vitamin B12 supplementation, but the evidence is very uncertain. The effects of vitamin B12 supplementation on other primary outcomes assessed in this review were not reported, or were not reported in a format for inclusion in quantitative analyses. Vitamin B12 supplementation during pregnancy may improve maternal and infant vitamin B12 status, but the potential impact on longer-term clinical and functional maternal and child health outcomes has not yet been established.	Giving vitamin B12 supplements during pregnancy might lower the chances of the mother becoming deficient in vitamin B12. It might also improve the mother's vitamin B12 levels during pregnancy or after childbirth compared to not giving any supplements or giving a placebo. However, we're not completely sure about this. We couldn't gather enough information to determine how vitamin B12 supplements affect other important aspects of pregnancy or childbirth.  While vitamin B12 supplements might improve the mother's and baby's vitamin B12 levels, we still don't know how it impacts their health in the long run.	Vitamin B12 supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the risk of maternal vitamin B12 deficiency and may improve maternal vitamin B12 concentrations during pregnancy or after childbirth compared to a placebo or no vitamin B12 supplementation, but the evidence is very uncertain. The effects of vitamin B12 supplementation on other primary outcomes assessed in this review were not reported, or were not reported in a format for inclusion in quantitative analyses. Vitamin B12 supplementation during pregnancy may improve maternal and infant vitamin B12 status, but the potential impact on longer-term clinical and functional maternal and child health outcomes has not yet been established.
89	The inability to have children affects 10% to 15% of couples worldwide. A male factor is estimated to account for up to half of the infertility cases with between 25% to 87% of male subfertility considered to be due to the effect of oxidative stress. Oral supplementation with antioxidants is thought to improve sperm quality by reducing oxidative damage. Antioxidants are widely available and inexpensive when compared to other fertility treatments, however most antioxidants are uncontrolled by regulation and the evidence for their effectiveness is uncertain. We compared the benefits and risks of different antioxidants used for male subfertility.	Around 10% to 15% of couples worldwide struggle to have children. Male factors are believed to be responsible for up to half of these infertility cases, with oxidative stress playing a role in 25% to 87% of male infertility. Taking antioxidants as supplements is thought to improve sperm quality by reducing damage caused by oxidative stress. These supplements are widely available and inexpensive compared to other fertility treatments, but many antioxidants are unregulated, and the evidence for their effectiveness is unclear. We investigated the benefits and risks of different antioxidants used for male infertility.	This study looked at the benefits and risks of different antioxidants used to treat male subfertility. The study found that about 10% to 15% of couples worldwide are unable to have children. The study also found that a male factor is responsible for up to half of infertility cases, with between 25% and 87% of male subfertility being due to the effects of oxidative stress. Antioxidants are commonly available and inexpensive compared to other fertility treatments, but most antioxidants are not controlled by regulation and the evidence for their effectiveness is uncertain. The study compared the benefits and risks of different antioxidants used for male subfertility.
90	At present none of the adjunctive tests can be recommended as a replacement for the currently used standard of a surgical biopsy and histological assessment. Given the relatively high values of the summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity for oral cytology, this would appear to offer the most potential. Combined adjunctive tests involving cytology warrant further investigation. Potentially eligible studies of blood and salivary biomarkers were excluded from the review as they were of a case-control design and therefore ineligible. In the absence of substantial improvement in the tests evaluated in this updated review, further research into biomarkers may be warranted.	Right now, there isn't a better way to find mouth sores than taking a piece of tissue (biopsy) and looking at it under a microscope. While using cells from the mouth (oral cytology) shows promise, it still needs more research. We didn't look at tests that use blood or saliva because they weren't the right kind of studies for this review. If we don't find better ways to test for mouth sores, then we might need to look into using blood or saliva tests.	This study looked at different tests that can be used to check for cancer in the mouth. They found that none of these tests can replace the current standard of a biopsy and histological assessment. However, because these tests are very good at detecting cancer in the mouth, they might be the best option. More research is needed to see if these tests can be combined with other tests that look at cancer in the mouth. They didn't include studies that looked at blood and saliva samples, so they weren't included in the review. If these tests don't make a big difference, more research is needed to find better ways to measure cancer in the mouth.
91	Treating very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with pharmacologic doses of vitamin E as an antioxidant agent has been proposed for preventing or limiting retinopathy of prematurity, intracranial hemorrhage, hemolytic anemia, and chronic lung disease. However, excessive doses of vitamin E may result in concerning side effects. To assess the effects of vitamin E supplementation on morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. MEDLINE (October 2002), EMBASE (March 2002), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), and personal files for clinical trials assessing vitamin E in preterm infants were searched. The MEDLINE and CCTR searches were updated in March 2007. Trials analyzing primary outcomes (mortality or combined long-term morbidity) or secondary outcomes (other morbidity) in infants with gestational age less than 37 weeks or birth weight less than 2500 grams were selected. The intervention was allocation to routine supplementation with vitamin E in the treatment group versus placebo, no treatment or another type, dose or route of administration of vitamin E. The standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used. Twenty-six randomized clinical trials fulfilled entry criteria. No study assessed combined long-term morbidity. Routine vitamin E supplementation significantly increased hemoglobin concentration by a small amount. Vitamin E significantly reduced the risk of germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage and increased the risk of sepsis; however, heterogeneity limits the strength of these latter two inferences. Vitamin E did not significantly affect other morbidity or mortality. In VLBW infants, vitamin E supplementation significantly increased the risk of sepsis, and reduced the risk of severe retinopathy and blindness among those examined. Subgroup analyses demonstrated (1) an association between intravenous, high-dose vitamin E supplementation and increased risk of sepsis and of parenchymal cerebral hemorrhage; (2) an association between vitamin E supplementation by other than the intravenous route and reduced risk of germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage and of severe intraventricular hemorrhage; and (3) an association between serum tocopherol levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl and increased risk of sepsis and reduced risk for severe retinopathy among those examined. Vitamin E supplementation in preterm infants reduced the risk of intracranial hemorrhage but increased the risk of sepsis. In very low birth weight infants, vitamin E increased the risk of sepsis, and reduced the risk of severe retinopathy and blindness among those examined. Evidence does not support the routine use of vitamin E supplementation by intravenous route at high doses or aiming at serum tocopherol levels greater than 3.5 mg/dl.	Doctors have been thinking about giving extra vitamin E to very small babies born early (before 37 weeks) to protect them from some serious health problems like eye problems, bleeding in the brain, blood problems, and lung problems.  Vitamin E is a kind of antioxidant that helps protect cells. However, too much vitamin E can cause problems too. To see if giving extra vitamin E to these babies is really a good idea, researchers looked at many studies where some babies got extra vitamin E and others didn't.  They found that extra vitamin E did help with some problems, like bleeding in the brain. But it also increased the risk of infections.  The researchers found that giving extra vitamin E by injection (into a vein) was particularly risky and shouldn't be done regularly.  They also found that having too much vitamin E in the blood was also linked to infections. So, giving extra vitamin E to premature babies needs to be carefully considered, and doctors should probably not give it regularly by injection or try to get levels in the blood too high.	This study looked at the effects of giving vitamin E to very low birth weight (VLBW) babies. Vitamin E is a type of antioxidant that can help prevent or slow down problems like retinopathy of prematurity, intracranial hemorrhage, hemolytic anemia, and chronic lung disease. However, giving too much vitamin E can have serious side effects. The study found that giving vitamin E regularly increased hemoglobin levels by a small amount, reduced the risk of germinal matrix/intraventricular hemorrhage, and increased the risk of sepsis. However, the study also found that giving vitamin E regularly increased the risk of sepsis and reduced the risk of severe retinopathy and blindness in VLBW infants. The study also found that vitamin E supplementation increased the risk of sepsis and reduced the risk of severe retinopathy and blindness.
92	We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 31 July 2017). We also systematically searched 19 electronic databases including; CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 7 in the Cochrane Library (searched July 2017), MEDLINE Ovid (1950 to August 2017), Embase Ovid (1980 to August 2017), CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1937 to August 2017), PsycINFO Ovid (1806 to August 2017), AMED Ovid (Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), SPORTDiscus EBSCO (1830 to August 2017). We searched relevant ongoing trials and research registers (searched December 2016), the Chinese medical database, Wanfangdata (searched to November 2016), and reference lists, and contacted researchers in the field.

93	Dental caries (tooth decay) is a common disease that is preventable by reducing the dietary intake of free sugars and using topical sodium fluoride products. An antibacterial agent known as chlorhexidine may also help prevent caries. A number of over-the-counter and professionally administered chlorhexidine-based preparations are available in a variety of formulations and in a range of strengths. Although previous reviews have concluded that some formulations of chlorhexidine may be effective in inhibiting the progression of established caries in children, there is currently a lack of evidence to either claim or refute a benefit for its use in preventing dental caries.	Tooth decay, also known as dental caries, is a common problem that can be prevented.  You can prevent it by eating less sugar and using toothpaste with fluoride.  There's a special antibacterial medicine called chlorhexidine that might also help.  It comes in different forms, like toothpaste, mouthwash, and gels.  While some types of chlorhexidine can help stop existing cavities in children, we don't know for sure if it can actually prevent cavities from forming in the first place.

94	Bipolar disorder is one of the most common serious mental illnesses, affecting approximately 60 million people worldwide. Characterised by extreme alterations in mood, cognition, and behaviour, bipolar disorder can have a significant negative impact on the functioning and quality of life of the affected individual. Compared with the general population, the prevalence of comorbid obesity is significantly higher in bipolar disorder. Approximately 68% of treatment seeking bipolar patients are overweight or obese. Clinicians are aware that obesity has the potential to contribute to other physical health conditions in people with bipolar disorder, including diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of premature death in bipolar disorder, happening a decade or more earlier than in the general population. Contributing factors include illness-related factors (mood-related factors, i.e. mania or depression), treatment-related factors (weight implications and other side effects of medications), and lifestyle factors (physical inactivity, poor diet, smoking, substance abuse). Approaches to the management of obesity in individuals with bipolar disorder are diverse and include non-pharmacological interventions (i.e. dietary, exercise, behavioural, or multi-component), pharmacological interventions (i.e. weight loss drugs or medication switching), and bariatric surgery.	Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness that affects about 60 million people worldwide. People with bipolar disorder have extreme mood swings, strange thoughts, and changes in their behavior.  This can make it very difficult for them to live a normal life.  People with bipolar disorder are much more likely to be overweight or obese compared to the general population. Around 68% of people with bipolar disorder who seek treatment are overweight or obese.  This can lead to other health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and even premature death.  These health problems can be caused by the disorder itself, the medications used to treat it, and unhealthy lifestyle choices like lack of exercise, poor diet, and smoking.  There are many different ways to help people with bipolar disorder lose weight, including diet changes, exercise programs, behavioral therapy, and even surgery.	Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness that affects millions of people worldwide. It causes extreme changes in mood, thinking, and behavior. Bipolar disorder can have a big impact on how people function and their quality of life. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to be overweight or obese compared to the general population. Doctors know that obesity can contribute to other physical health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of premature death in people with bipolar disorder, occurring a decade or more earlier than in the general population. Factors that contribute to obesity include illness-related factors (mood-related factors), treatment-related factors (weight implications and other side effects of medications), and lifestyle factors (physical inactivity, poor diet, smoking, and substance abuse).

95	Aspirin is used with the aim of optimising the chance of live birth in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), despite inconsistent evidence of its efficacy and safety (in terms of intraoperative bleeding during oocyte retrieval and risk of miscarriage). The most appropriate time to commence aspirin therapy and the length of treatment required are also still to be determined. This is the second update of the review first published in 2007.	Doctors sometimes give aspirin to women who are having trouble getting pregnant and are using treatments like IVF (in vitro fertilization) to help them get pregnant. The goal is to increase the chances of having a healthy baby. However, there's no clear evidence that aspirin works or is safe in this situation.  Some studies show it might help, but others don't. We also don't know the best time to start taking aspirin or how long women should take it. This is an update of a review we first did in 2007.	Aspirin is used to improve the chances of having a baby in women who are having assisted reproductive technology (ART). However, there isn't enough evidence to say for sure if it's effective or safe, especially when it comes to bleeding during oocyte retrieval and risk of miscarriage. The best time to start aspirin treatment and how long it takes to start treatment are still being determined. This is the second update of a review that was first published in 2007.
96	Single component interventions (e.g. education or motivational interviewing provided by a health professional) can help to improve adherence to pharmacotherapy (low to very low certainty). There were slight improvements in quality of life with a Bluetooth inhaler device, but evidence is from one study and very low certainty. Change to pharmacotherapy (e.g. single inhaler instead of two, or different doses of roflumilast) has little impact on hospitalisations or exacerbations (very low certainty). There is no difference in people experiencing adverse events (all-cause or COPD-related), or deaths (very low certainty). Multi-component interventions may improve adherence with education, motivational or behavioural components delivered by health professionals (low certainty). There is little to no impact on quality of life (low to very low certainty). They may help reduce the number of people admitted to hospital overall (specifically pharmacist-led approaches) (low certainty), and fewer people may have COPD-related hospital admissions (moderately certainty). There may be a small reduction in people experiencing severe exacerbations, but evidence is from one study (low certainty). Limited evidence found no difference in people experiencing adverse events, serious adverse events or deaths (low to very low certainty). The evidence presented should be interpreted with caution. Larger studies with more intervention types, especially single interventions, are needed. It is unclear which specific COPD subgroups would benefit, therefore discussions between health professionals and patients may help to determine whether they will help to improve health outcomes.	This document talks about different ways to help people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) stick to their medication plans. It also looks at how these methods affect their quality of life and if they lead to fewer hospital visits or serious COPD complications. The document found that some single methods, like talking to a doctor about the importance of medication or using motivational techniques, might slightly improve medication adherence. Using a Bluetooth inhaler device also showed a slight improvement in quality of life, but more studies are needed to be sure. Changing the medication itself didn't seem to have much impact on hospitalizations or complications. Combining several methods together, like education, motivation, and behavior changes, might improve adherence and reduce hospital visits, but more research is needed to confirm this. There isn't enough evidence to say for sure if any of these methods affect the number of adverse events or deaths. It's important to talk to a doctor about which methods might be best for you, as the document isn't clear about which specific COPD groups benefit the most.	This study looked at different ways to help people with COPD stick to their medications. One way was to use a Bluetooth inhaler, but the evidence was weak. One way was to use a single inhaler instead of two, or to use a different dose of roflumilast, but the evidence was weak. One way was to use a single inhaler instead of two, or to use a different dose of roflumilast, but the evidence was weak. One way was to use a single inhaler instead of two, or to use a different dose of roflumilast, but the evidence was weak and the evidence was weak. Another way was to use a multi-component approach, where health professionals delivered education, motivational materials, or behavioral changes. The evidence was weak and the evidence was weak. The evidence presented should be interpreted with caution. Larger studies with more interventions, especially single interventions, are needed. It's unclear which specific groups of people would benefit from these interventions. Therefore, discussions between healthcare professionals and patients might help determine if these interventions will improve health outcomes.
97	Indomethacin therapy for closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) frequently causes oliguria and occasionally more serious renal dysfunction. Low dose dopamine has been suggested as a means for preventing this side effect. To determine whether dopamine therapy prevents indomethacin-mediated deterioration in renal function in the preterm newborn infant without serious adverse effects. Subgroup analyses were planned to assess the effects of dopamine on patients given indomethacin as prophylaxis of intraventricular hemorrhage, and patients given indomethacin as treatment of PDA. Standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG) were used. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2009), MEDLINE (1966 to 2009), EMBASE (1974 to 2009) and CINAHL (2001 to 2009). In addition, we contacted the principal investigators if necessary to ascertain required information. Randomized or quasi-randomized studies of the effects of dopamine on urine output, glomerular filtration rate, fluid balance or incidence of renal failure, in preterm newborn infants receiving indomethacin. The comparison group should have received no dopamine. We used the standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and those of the CNRG. For categorical outcomes, we calculated typical estimates for relative risk and risk difference. For continuous outcomes the weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated. Fixed effect models were assumed for meta-analysis. Three studies were found (total number randomized patients 75) that fulfilled the entry criteria for this review. All were single center trials that enrolled NICU patients receiving indomethacin for symptomatic PDA. There are no (or only partial) results for effects of dopamine on several of the primary outcomes, including death before discharge, serious intraventricular hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, or renal failure. There has been inadequate investigation of the effects of dopamine on cerebral perfusion or cardiac output, or GI complications, or endocrine toxicity. Dopamine improved urine output [WMD 0.68 ml/kg/hour (95% CI 0.22, 1.44)], but there was no evidence of effect on serum creatinine (WMD 2.04 micromoles/liter, CI -17.90, 21.97) or the incidence of oliguria (urine output < 1 ml/kg/hour) (RR 0.73, CI 0.35, 1.54). There was no evidence of effect of dopamine on the frequency of failure to close the ductus arteriosus (RR 1.11, CI 0.56, 2.19). There is no evidence from randomized trials to support the use of dopamine to prevent renal dysfunction in indomethacin-treated preterm infants.	Indomethacin is a medicine used to close a hole in the heart called a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature babies. Sometimes, this medicine can cause problems with the kidneys, making the baby pee less. Doctors have thought that giving another medicine called dopamine might help prevent this problem. This study looked at whether dopamine can prevent kidney problems in premature babies who are taking indomethacin.  They looked at 75 babies in three different studies, and they found that dopamine did improve urine output, but it didn't seem to affect kidney function or how much the babies peed. They also found that dopamine didn't help prevent the PDA from closing or cause any other problems.  Overall, the researchers concluded that there isn't enough evidence to say that dopamine is helpful for preventing kidney problems in premature babies who are taking indomethacin.	This study looked at whether a medicine called dopamine could help prevent kidney problems in premature babies who were taking indomethacin. Indomethacin is a medicine used to treat a condition called patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). PDA often causes oliguria and sometimes more serious kidney problems. Dopamine has been suggested as a way to prevent these problems. The researchers wanted to see if dopamine could help prevent kidney problems in premature babies who were taking indomethacin. They looked at studies that compared dopamine to other treatments. They found three studies that met their criteria. These studies included babies in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) who were taking indomethacin for PDA. They found that dopamine improved urine output, glomerular filtration rate, fluid balance, and kidney function in premature babies. However, more research is needed to understand if dopamine helps prevent kidney problems in premature babies.
98	Eight randomized trials across varying healthcare contexts in the USA,. India, China, Guatemala, Ghana, and Kenya, met our inclusion criteria. A range of healthcare providers (facility and community-based, formally trained, and lay workers) used digital CDSS. Care was provided for the management of specific conditions such as cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal risk assessment, and maternal and child health. The certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate, and we often downgraded evidence for risk of bias and imprecision. We are uncertain of the effect of this intervention on providers' adherence to recommended practice due to the very low certainty evidence (2 studies, 185 participants). The effect of the intervention on patients' and clients' health behaviours such as smoking and treatment adherence is mixed, with substantial variation across outcomes for similar types of behaviour (2 studies, 2262 participants). The intervention probably makes little or no difference to smoking rates among people at risk of cardiovascular disease but probably increases other types of desired behaviour among patients, such as adherence to treatment. The effect of the intervention on patients'/clients' health status and well-being is also mixed (5 studies, 69,767 participants). It probably makes little or no difference to some types of health outcomes, but we are uncertain about other health outcomes, including maternal and neonatal deaths, due to very low-certainty evidence. The intervention may slightly improve patient or client acceptability and satisfaction (1 study, 187 participants). We found no studies that reported the time between the presentation of an illness and appropriate management, provider acceptability or satisfaction, resource use, or unintended consequences.	We looked at eight studies from different countries that used digital tools to help healthcare providers give better care for conditions like heart disease, stomach problems, and mothers and children. The evidence on how well these tools worked was mixed. We weren't sure if they helped providers follow recommended guidelines. The tools seemed to help patients with some things, like taking their medicine, but they didn't seem to help everyone stop smoking. We also found that these tools might help patients feel better about their care.	This study looked at whether using a digital tool called CDSS helped healthcare providers in the USA, China, Guatemala, Ghana, and Kenya manage specific health conditions like heart disease, gastrointestinal risk assessment, and maternal and child health. The study found that there wasn't enough strong evidence to say for sure if CDSS helped doctors follow their recommended practices. It also found that CDSS probably didn't make much difference in how often people at risk of heart disease smoke, but it probably helped people stick to their treatment plans. The study also found that CDSS might slightly improve patients' overall health and well-being, but more research is needed to be sure.
99	Based on the current evidence, in people hospitalised with moderate to severe COVID-19 the use of colchicine probably has little to no influence on mortality or clinical progression in comparison to placebo or standard care alone. We do not know whether colchicine increases the risk of (serious) adverse events. We are uncertain about the evidence of the effect of colchicine on all-cause mortality for people with asymptomatic infection or mild disease. However, colchicine probably results in a slight reduction of hospital admissions or deaths within 28 days, and the rate of serious adverse events compared with placebo. None of the studies reported data on quality of life or compared the benefits and harms of colchicine versus other drugs, or different dosages of colchicine. We identified 17 ongoing and 11 completed but not published RCTs, which we expect to incorporate in future versions of this review as their results become available. Editorial note: due to the living approach of this work, we monitor newly published results of RCTs on colchicine on a weekly basis and will update the review when the evidence or our certainty in the evidence changes.	This study looked at whether a drug called colchicine helps people who are hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19. The results suggest that colchicine probably doesn't make much of a difference in how sick people get or whether they die compared to other treatments. We don't know if colchicine increases the risk of side effects.  For people with mild or no symptoms, we don't have enough information to say whether colchicine helps. However, it may slightly reduce the number of hospital admissions or deaths within the first 28 days, and the number of serious side effects compared to a placebo.  The studies we reviewed did not look at how colchicine affects quality of life or compare it to other medications or different doses.  More studies are ongoing and will be included in future updates as they are completed.  We regularly update this study based on new information.	This study looked at whether a medicine called colchicine helps people with moderate to severe COVID-19 who are in the hospital. The study found that colchicine probably doesn't have a big impact on how long people live or how well their COVID-19 progresses compared to a fake medicine (placebo) or standard care alone. However, we don't know if colchicine increases the risk of serious side effects. We're not sure if colchicine increases the risk of serious side effects for people with mild COVID-19. However, colchicine might slightly reduce hospital admissions or deaths within 28 days, and the risk of serious side effects compared to a fake medicine (placebo). None of the studies looked at quality of life or compared colchicine to other drugs, or different dosages of colchicine. We found 17 ongoing and 11 completed but not published RCTs, which we expect to include in future versions of this review as their results become available. Due to the living approach of this research, we monitor new published results of RCTs on colchicine on a weekly basis and will update the review when the evidence or our certainty in the evidence changes.
100	Second trimester amniocentesis increased the risk of pregnancy loss, but it was not possible to quantify this increase precisely from only one study, carried out more than 30 years ago. Early amniocentesis was not as safe as second trimester amniocentesis, illustrated by increased pregnancy loss and congenital anomalies (talipes). Transcervical chorionic villus sampling compared with second trimester amniocentesis may be associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss, but results were quite heterogeneous. Diagnostic accuracy of different methods could not be assessed adequately because of incomplete karyotype data in most studies.	A procedure called amniocentesis, done during pregnancy to check for genetic problems in the baby, was found to be linked to a higher chance of the pregnancy ending in a miscarriage. However, the exact risk couldn't be determined with certainty from just one study conducted over 30 years ago. An earlier version of amniocentesis, performed during the first trimester, was even less safe than the later one, with a higher risk of both pregnancy loss and birth defects. Another prenatal testing method called chorionic villus sampling, done during the first trimester, may also be associated with a greater risk of miscarriage compared to second trimester amniocentesis, but the results are inconsistent. It's difficult to compare the accuracy of these methods because many studies lacked complete information about the baby's genetic makeup.	This study looked at a procedure called a second trimester amniocentesis, which is a procedure that takes place during the second trimester of pregnancy. The study found that a second trimester amniocentesis increased the risk of pregnancy loss, but it was difficult to quantify this increase precisely from only one study, done over 30 years ago. Early amniocentesis was not as safe as second trimester amniocentesis, demonstrating increased pregnancy loss and congenital anomalies (talipes). Transcervical chorionic villus sampling compared to second trimester amniocentesis might be associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss, but results were quite different. The accuracy of different methods couldn't be assessed adequately because of incomplete karyotype data in most studies.
101	There is moderate-quality evidence that double gloving compared to single gloving during surgery reduces perforations and blood stains on the skin, indicating a decrease in percutaneous exposure incidents. There is low-quality evidence that triple gloving and the use of special gloves can further reduce the risk of glove perforations compared to double gloving with normal material gloves. The preventive effect of double gloves on percutaneous exposure incidents in surgery does not need further research. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of special material gloves and triple gloves, and of gloves in other occupational groups.	There is strong evidence that wearing two pairs of gloves during surgery reduces the number of needlesticks and other accidental exposures to sharp objects. This is because it helps prevent glove punctures and blood stains on the skin.  There is less strong evidence that using three pairs of gloves or special gloves made of stronger material can further reduce the risk of glove punctures.  However, it is clear that wearing two pairs of gloves during surgery is effective and doesn't need further research.  We need to do more studies to see how effective these other types of gloves are and whether they're worth the extra cost.  We also need to look at whether these types of gloves are useful in other professions besides surgery.	This study looked at whether double gloving, which is wearing a pair of gloves at the same time, is better than just wearing one glove during surgery. It found that double gloving helps prevent cuts and blood stains on the skin, which means there are fewer accidents. However, there's not enough evidence to say for sure if triple gloving or special gloves are better than double gloving with normal gloves. More research is needed to see if triple gloving and special gloves are more effective and cost-effective than double gloving with normal gloves.
102	Two review authors screened titles and abstracts of the citations produced by the literature search and excluded obviously irrelevant studies. We obtained the full text of all remaining studies, and both review authors then independently selected trials for inclusion. We combined studies when the review produced a minimum of two trials employing a particular intervention strategy and a common outcome. We considered the primary outcome to be the ability of the arm to be used for appropriate tasks, called upper extremity activity. Secondary outcomes included upper extremity impairment (such as quality of movement, range of motion, tone, presence of synergistic movement), activities of daily living (ADLs), health-related quality of life (HRQL), economic costs, and adverse events. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies and applied GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We completed subgroup analyses for time since stroke, dosage of MP, type of comparison, and type of arm activity outcome measure.	Two experts looked at the titles and summaries of all the studies we found. They removed any studies that were clearly not relevant to our research. We then got the full text of the remaining studies and two experts independently decided which studies to include in our review. We combined studies that used the same treatment and measured the same outcome. We were mostly interested in how well people could use their arms after a stroke. We also looked at things like how well people could move their arms, how well they could do everyday tasks, and how they felt about their health. We considered how reliable the studies were and rated the quality of the evidence. We also looked at how long it had been since the stroke, how much treatment people got, and how the treatment compared to other methods.	This study looked at different ways to help people who have had a stroke use their arms more effectively. They looked at studies that tested different ways to help people use their arms for different tasks. They found that the most important thing was how well people could move their arms, which is called upper extremity activity. They also looked at other things like how well people could do everyday things, their quality of life, and any side effects. They also looked at how reliable the studies were and used a system called GRADE to make sure they were reliable.
103	In view of the methodological deficiencies, the limited number of included studies and the differences in outcome measures, we have found no reliable evidence to support the use of felbamate as an add-on therapy in people with drug-resistant focal-onset epilepsy. A large-scale, randomised controlled trial conducted over a longer period of time is required to inform clinical practice.	Because of the problems with the studies, the small number of studies included, and the differences in how the results were measured, we haven't found strong evidence to say that felbamate is a good medicine to add to other treatments for people with epilepsy that doesn't get better with other medicines. We need a big, well-designed study that lasts a long time to know for sure if felbamate is helpful.	We found no reliable evidence to support the use of felbamate as an add-on therapy for people with drug-resistant focal-onset epilepsy. We need a large, randomized controlled trial conducted over a longer period of time to inform clinical practice.
104	The evidence on palliative care interventions in advanced dementia is limited in quantity and certainty. When compared to usual care, changes to the organisation and delivery of care for people with advanced dementia may lead to improvements in comfort in dying, but the evidence for this was of very low certainty. Advance care planning interventions, compared to usual care, probably increase the documentation of advance directives and the occurrence of discussions about goals of care, and may also increase concordance with goals of care. We did not detect other effects. The uncertainty in the evidence across all outcomes in both comparisons is mainly driven by imprecision of effect estimates and risk of bias in the included studies.	There's not much good evidence about how to help people with advanced dementia.  We don't know for sure if changing how we care for them makes them more comfortable when they are dying. However, talking with families ahead of time about their loved one's wishes for care, such as whether they want life-sustaining treatments, probably leads to more documentation of those wishes and more discussions about what kind of care they want. It might also mean that their care aligns better with what they want.  We haven't found that changing how we care for people with advanced dementia has any other benefits. The uncertainty in the evidence is mostly due to the small number of studies and problems with the way they were done.	We don't have enough good evidence to say for sure if palliative care helps people with advanced dementia. Palliative care is a type of care that helps people feel better when they die. We found that changes to how care is organized and delivered might help people feel more comfortable when they die, but we don't have enough evidence to say for sure. We also found that changes to advance care planning might make it easier to document advance directives and talk about goals for care. We didn't find any other effects. The uncertainty in the evidence is mainly because the studies we looked at were not very precise and had some problems with how they were done.
105	Oxidative stress has been implicated in the development of a number of conditions including cancer, arthritic disorders and cardiovascular disease. Pycnogenol(r), a herbal dietary supplement derived from French maritime pine bark extract, is standardised to contain 70% procyanidin which is a powerful antioxidant. Pycnogenol(r) is marketed as a supplement for preventing or treating a wide range of chronic conditions. To assess the efficacy and safety of Pycnogenol(r) for the treatment of chronic disorders. We searched CENTRAL (until 18 September 2010), MEDLINE (until 18 September 2010) and EMBASE (until 13 October 2010) as well as three trial registries. We also contacted the manufacturer of Pycnogenol(r) and hand-searched bibliographies of included studies. Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of Pycnogenol(r) in adults or children with any chronic disorder were included. We assessed clinical outcomes directly related to the disorder (stratified as participant- and investigator-reported) and all-cause mortality as primary outcomes. We also assessed adverse events and biomarkers of oxidative stress. Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted all data and assessed risk of bias. A third author additionally extracted information on outcomes and results. With three exceptions, results for outcomes across studies could not be pooled. This review includes 15 trials with a total of 791 participants that have evaluated Pycnogenol(r) for the treatment of seven different chronic disorders. These included asthma (two studies; N = 86), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (one study; N = 61), chronic venous insufficiency (two studies; N = 60), diabetes mellitus (four studies; N = 201), erectile dysfunction (one study; N = 21), hypertension (two studies; N = 69) and osteoarthritis (three studies; N = 293). Two of the studies were conducted exclusively in children; the others involved adults. Due to small sample size, limited numbers of trials per condition, variation in outcomes evaluated and outcome measures used, as well as the risk of bias in the included studies, no definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy or safety of Pycnogenol(r) are possible. Current evidence is insufficient to support Pycnogenol(r) use for the treatment of any chronic disorder. Well-designed, adequately powered trials are needed to establish the value of this treatment.	Oxidative stress is a problem that can lead to many health issues like cancer, arthritis, and heart disease. Pycnogenol is a supplement made from pine bark extract. It is said to be a powerful antioxidant that helps fight oxidative stress. People market Pycnogenol as a way to prevent or treat a wide range of chronic conditions. We wanted to find out if Pycnogenol really works and if it's safe to use. We looked at several scientific studies on Pycnogenol. We found 15 studies involving 791 people. These studies looked at Pycnogenol's effects on various health problems like asthma, ADHD, chronic venous insufficiency, diabetes, erectile dysfunction, high blood pressure, and osteoarthritis. Unfortunately, the studies were too small and different in how they were conducted. This made it difficult to draw firm conclusions about whether Pycnogenol is effective or safe for treating these conditions. We need more research with bigger groups of people and consistent methods to understand if Pycnogenol is truly helpful.	This study looked at the effectiveness and safety of a herbal supplement called Pycnogenol(r) for treating chronic conditions like asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, chronic venous insufficiency, diabetes, erectile dysfunction, high blood pressure, and osteoarthritis. The researchers reviewed 15 studies with a total of 791 participants that tested Pycnogenol(r) for treating seven different chronic conditions. These conditions included asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, chronic venous insufficiency, diabetes, erectile dysfunction, high blood pressure, and osteoarthritis. Because the studies were small and had some limitations, the researchers couldn't draw any definitive conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of Pycnogenol(r).
106	We included 98 studies (147 articles). There were 88 core studies: 37 focused on advocates (4 survey-based, 3 instrument development, 30 qualitative focus) and seven on abused women (6 qualitative studies, 1 survey); 44 were experimental intervention studies (some including qualitative evaluations). Ten further studies (3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 1 intervention process evaluation, 1 qualitative study, 2 mixed methods studies, 2 surveys of women, and 1 mixed methods study of women and staff) did not fit the original criteria but added useful information, as befitting a realist approach. Two studies are awaiting classification and three are ongoing. Advocacy interventions varied considerably in contact hours, profession delivering and setting. We constructed a conceptual model from six essential principles based on context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) patterns. We have moderate and high confidence in evidence for the importance of considering both women's vulnerabilities and intersectionalities and the trade-offs of abuse-related decisions in the contexts of individual women's lives. Decisions should consider the risks to the woman's safety from the abuse. Whether actions resulting from advocacy increase or decrease abuse depends on contextual factors (e.g. severity and type of abuse), and the outcomes the particular advocacy intervention is designed to address (e.g. increasing successful court orders versus decreasing depression). We have low confidence in evidence regarding the significance of physical dependencies, being pregnant or having children. There were links between setting (high confidence), and potentially also theoretical underpinnings of interventions, type, duration and intensity of advocacy, advocate discipline and outcomes (moderate and low confidence). A good therapeutic alliance was important (high confidence); this alliance might be improved when advocates are matched with abused women on ethnicity or abuse experience, exercise cultural humility, and remove structural barriers to resource access by marginalised women. We identified significant challenges for advocates in inter-organisational working, vicarious traumatisation, and lack of clarity on how much support to give a woman (moderate and high confidence). To work effectively, advocates need ongoing training, role clarity, access to resources, and peer and institutional support. Our provisional model highlights the complex way that factors combine and interact for effective advocacy. We confirmed the core ingredients of advocacy according to both women and advocates, supported by studies and theoretical considerations: education and information on abuse; rights and resources; active referral and liaising with other services; risk assessment and safety planning. We were unable to confirm the impact of complexity of the intervention (low confidence). Our low confidence in the evidence was driven mostly by a lack of relevant studies, rather than poor-quality studies, despite the size of the review.	This study looked at 98 different research papers about how advocates can help women who are being abused.  We found that there are many different ways that advocates can help, and that the best way to help depends on the individual woman's situation. We found that it's important to consider the woman's vulnerabilities and the risks to her safety. It's also important to consider the woman's individual needs and the type of abuse she's experiencing. We found that a good relationship between the advocate and the woman is very important, and that this relationship can be improved by things like matching advocates and women based on their ethnicity or experiences with abuse, and by making sure that all women have access to the resources they need. We also found that advocates face some challenges, such as dealing with the emotional impact of working with abused women, and figuring out how much support to give each woman. To be effective, advocates need ongoing training, clear roles, access to resources, and support from other advocates and organizations.	This study looked at how to help women who have been abused. The researchers reviewed 98 studies involving abused women and advocates. They found that advocates need to consider both women's vulnerabilities and intersectional factors when making decisions about abuse. They also need to consider the risks to the woman's safety from the abuse. The study also found that advocates need to be matched with abused women based on their ethnicity or abuse experience, exercise cultural humility, and address barriers to accessing resources. They also found that advocates need ongoing training, clear roles, access to resources, and support from peers and institutions to work effectively.
107	Keratoconus is the most common corneal dystrophy. It can cause loss of uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity through ectasia (thinning) of the central or paracentral cornea, irregular corneal scarring, or corneal perforation. Disease onset usually occurs in the second to fourth decade of life, periods of peak educational attainment or career development. The condition is lifelong and sight-threatening. Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) using ultraviolet A (UVA) light applied to the cornea is the only treatment that has been shown to slow progression of disease. The original, more widely known technique involves application of UVA light to de-epithelialized cornea, to which a photosensitizer (riboflavin) is added topically throughout the irradiation process. Transepithelial CXL is a recently advocated alternative to the standard CXL procedure, in that the epithelium is kept intact during CXL. Retention of the epithelium offers the putative advantages of faster healing, less patient discomfort, faster visual rehabilitation, and less risk of corneal haze.	Keratoconus is a common eye condition that can cause blurry vision. This happens when the cornea, the clear front part of the eye, thins and becomes misshapen. It can also lead to scarring or even a hole in the cornea. This condition usually starts in young adults, a time when they are often busy with school or work.  There is no cure for keratoconus, but there is a treatment called corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) that can help slow down the progression of the disease. CXL involves using ultraviolet light to strengthen the cornea. The traditional CXL method involves removing the outer layer of the cornea before applying the light. A newer method called transepithelial CXL keeps the outer layer of the cornea intact, which may lead to faster healing and less discomfort.	Keratoconus is a common eye condition that affects the cornea. It can make it hard for people to see clearly, and it can cause problems like thinning of the cornea, scarring, or holes in the cornea. The disease usually starts in the second to fourth decade of life, when people are getting better at school or working. It can be life-threatening. The only treatment that has been shown to slow down the disease is called corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL). CXL uses ultraviolet A (UVA) light applied to the cornea, and a special substance called riboflavin is added to the light. Transepithelial CXL is a newer treatment that keeps the cornea intact during CXL. This could lead to faster healing, less discomfort, faster visual rehabilitation, and less risk of corneal haze.
108	Three review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for one additional event, using standard methods. Our primary outcomes were participant-reported pain relief of 50%, or 30%, or greater; Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) very much improved, or much or very much improved. Our secondary outcomes included adverse events, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events. We assessed GRADE and created three'Summary of findings' tables.	We wanted to see if certain treatments were effective in reducing pain in people with sickle cell disease.  We looked at studies that used different treatments and measured how much pain relief people reported. We also looked at how many people had side effects from the treatments.  We used standard methods to analyze the results and created summaries of our findings.	This study looked at how well a pain reliever worked for people with chronic pain. We wanted to see if the pain relief was 50% or 30% or greater, and if the pain relief was very much improved. We also looked at side effects, serious side effects, and how many people stopped taking the medicine because of side effects. We used a system called GRADE to judge the quality of the studies and created three tables summarizing our findings.
109	Metastatic breast cancer is not a curable disease, but women with metastatic disease are living longer. Surgery to remove the primary tumour is associated with an increased survival in other types of metastatic cancer. Breast surgery is not standard treatment for metastatic disease, however several recent retrospective studies have suggested that breast surgery could increase the women's survival. These studies have methodological limitations including selection bias. A systematic review mapping all randomised controlled trials addressing the benefits and potential harms of breast surgery is ideal to answer this question.	Metastatic breast cancer, where cancer has spread, can't be cured, but women are living longer with it.  In other cancers where it has spread, surgery to remove the original tumor can help people live longer.  While surgery isn't standard for metastatic breast cancer, some recent studies suggest it might help women live longer, but these studies have some problems that make the results uncertain.  To get a clear answer, we need a large study that compares surgery plus treatment to just treatment alone.	Metastatic breast cancer is not a cureable disease, but women with metastatic breast cancer live longer. Surgery to remove the primary tumor is linked to an increased survival in other types of metastatic cancer. Breast surgery is not the standard treatment for metastatic disease, but several recent retrospective studies suggest that breast surgery might increase the women's survival. However, these studies have limitations, including biases in their selection. A systematic review mapping all randomised controlled trials addressing the benefits and potential harms of breast surgery is ideal to answer this question.
110	Very preterm infants often require respiratory support and are therefore exposed to an increased risk of chronic lung disease and later neurodevelopmental disability. Although methylxanthines are widely used to prevent and treat apnea associated with prematurity and to facilitate extubation, there is uncertainty about the benefits and harms of different types of methylxanthines.	Babies born very early often need help breathing and are therefore at risk for chronic lung problems and later developmental delays. While methylxanthines are commonly used to prevent and treat breathing problems in premature babies and to help them come off breathing machines, there is uncertainty about the benefits and risks of different types of methylxanthines.	Very premature babies often need breathing support and are at a higher risk of lung problems and later brain problems. While methylxanthines are commonly used to prevent and treat sleep apnea associated with premature babies and to help them breathe easier, there is uncertainty about the benefits and risks of different types of methylxanthines.
111	We included 64 studies (78 references) and 4547 participants in this review, and classified 12 additional studies as ongoing. A further 12 studies await classification, as we were unable to obtain the full texts. Most of the studies were conducted in high altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low pressure (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure. Twenty-four trials provided the intervention between three and five days prior to the ascent, and 23 trials, between one and two days beforehand. Most of the included studies reached a final altitude of between 4001 and 5000 metres above sea level. Risks of bias were unclear for several domains, and a considerable number of studies did not report adverse events of the evaluated interventions. We found 26 comparisons, 15 of them comparing commonly-used drugs versus placebo. We report results for the three most important comparisons: Acetazolamide versus placebo (28 parallel studies; 2345 participants) The risk of AMS was reduced with acetazolamide (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.56; I2 = 0%; 16 studies; 2301 participants; moderate quality of evidence). No events of HAPE were reported and only one event of HACE (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.48; 6 parallel studies; 1126 participants; moderate quality of evidence). Few studies reported side effects for this comparison, and they showed an increase in the risk of paraesthesia with the intake of acetazolamide (RR 5.53, 95% CI 2.81 to 10.88, I2 = 60%; 5 studies, 789 participants; low quality of evidence). Budenoside versus placebo (2 parallel studies; 132 participants) Data on budenoside showed a reduction in the incidence of AMS compared with placebo (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.61; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 132 participants; low quality of evidence). Studies included did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and they did not find side effects (low quality of evidence). Dexamethasone versus placebo (7 parallel studies; 205 participants) For dexamethasone, the data did not show benefits at any dosage (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.00; I2 = 39%; 4 trials, 176 participants; low quality of evidence). Included studies did not report events of HAPE or HACE, and we rated the evidence about adverse events as of very low quality.	This study looked at 64 different research papers about treatments for altitude sickness.  They included 4547 people who were going up to high altitudes. Most of the studies took place in mountains, while others used special chambers to recreate the effects of being high up. The treatments were usually given for a few days before people went up high.  We looked at how well three common medications worked.  Acetazolamide seemed to reduce the risk of getting sick from altitude.  We didn't see much evidence of serious side effects. Budenoside also seemed to work, but we only had a small number of studies. Dexamethasone didn't show much benefit.  We need more research on how all these medications work.	This review looked at 64 studies involving 4547 people. Most of the studies were done in high-altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low-pressure (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure. Most of the studies were done in high-altitude mountain areas, while the rest used low pressure (hypobaric) chambers to simulate altitude exposure.

We found 26 studies, 15 of them comparing commonly used drugs versus placebo. Acetazolamide showed a reduction in the risk of AMS compared to acetazolamide. Budenoside showed a reduction in HAPE and HACE, but it did not report any side effects. Dexamethasone did not report any benefits at any dosage.
112	Until operative treatment involving the use of various implants was introduced in the 1950s, hip fractures were managed using conservative methods based on traction and bed rest. To compare conservative with operative treatment for fractures of the proximal femur (hip) in adults. We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (March 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1988 to 2008), Current Controlled Trials, orthopaedic journals, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing these two treatment methods in adults with hip fracture. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Additional information was sought from trialists. After grouping by fracture type, comparable groups of trials were subgrouped by implant type and data were pooled where appropriate using the fixed-effect model. The five randomised trials included in the review involved only 428 elderly patients. One small and potentially biased trial of 23 patients with undisplaced intracapsular fracture showed a reduced risk of non-union for those fractures treated operatively. The four trials on extracapsular fractures tested a variety of surgical techniques and implant devices and only one trial involving 106 patients can be considered to test current practice. In this trial, no differences were found in medical complications, mortality and long-term pain. However, operative treatment was more likely to result in the fracture healing without leg shortening, a shorter hospital stay and a statistically non-significant increase in the return of patients back to their original residence. Although there is a lack of available evidence to inform practice for undisplaced intracapsular fractures, variation in practice has reduced and most fractures are treated surgically. The limited available evidence from randomised trials does not suggest major differences in outcome between conservative and operative management programmes for extracapsular femoral fractures, but operative treatment is associated with a reduced length of hospital stay and improved rehabilitation. Conservative treatment will be acceptable where modern surgical facilities are unavailable, and will result in a reduction in complications associated with surgery, but rehabilitation is likely to be slower and limb deformity more common. Currently, it is difficult to conceive circumstances in which future trials would be practical or viable.	Before the 1950s, broken hips were treated by keeping the leg still and using weights to pull on it. Then, doctors started using surgery and implants to fix broken hips. This study looked at whether it's better to treat broken hips with surgery or with traditional methods. They searched many medical databases and studies to find information about this. They found five studies that included only 428 elderly patients. One small study showed that surgery might help prevent some hip breaks from not healing properly. The other four studies looked at different surgical methods and implants for different types of hip breaks. One of these studies included 106 patients and found that surgery didn't cause more problems or deaths, and it led to faster healing. However, there wasn't enough evidence to say for sure whether surgery is better for all types of hip breaks.  There is a lot of variation in how doctors treat these breaks. While there isn't a clear answer yet, most doctors choose surgery for most hip breaks.	This study compared two different ways to treat hip fractures in adults. Until the 1950s, hip fractures were treated conservatively using traction and bed rest. The researchers looked at studies that compared these two methods in adults with hip fractures. They found that conservative treatment was more likely to reduce the risk of the fracture not coming together. However, surgical treatment was more likely to lead to the fracture healing without the leg shortening, a shorter hospital stay, and more patients returning to their original homes. While there isn't enough evidence to say whether conservative treatment is better than operative treatment for hip fractures, surgical treatment is likely to lead to a shorter hospital stay and improved rehabilitation. While conservative treatment is acceptable in places where modern surgical facilities are not available, rehabilitation is likely to be slower and limb deformity is more common.
113	We performed random-effects (RE) meta-analyses when two or more RCTs were available for a specific outcome. We conducted RE meta-analyses when five or more observational studies were available for a specific outcome. We assessed risk of bias in RCTs and in observational studies using Cochrane's risk assessment tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. We considered in the primary analysis data pooled from RCTs with low risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence by using the GRADE approach.	This study used a method called meta-analysis to combine the results of multiple research studies. This method was used when there were two or more studies looking at the same outcome in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or when there were five or more studies looking at the same outcome in observational studies. The quality of the research studies was assessed using specific tools to determine if they were reliable and had little risk of bias. The results of the study were based on the RCTs that were considered to be of high quality. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using a method called GRADE, which helps to determine how confident we can be in the results.	We looked at studies that compared different treatments for a specific condition. We used a special method called random-effects meta-analysis to combine the results of two or more studies. We also used this method when we had five or more observational studies.

We considered the primary analysis data from studies with low risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.
114	This is an updated version of the Cochrane review published in 2015. Around half of people with epilepsy will not achieve seizure freedom on their first antiepileptic drug; many will require add-on therapy. Around a third of people fail to achieve complete seizure freedom despite multiple antiepileptic drugs. Lacosamide has been licenced as an add-on therapy for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.	This is an updated version of a study from 2015 about people with epilepsy. Around half of people with epilepsy don't get rid of their seizures with their first medication, so they need to try another one. About a third of people still have seizures even after trying many different medications.  Lacosamide is a medication that has been approved for people with epilepsy who haven't been able to control their seizures with other medications.	This is an updated version of a review that was published in 2015. About half of people with epilepsy won't be able to stop their seizures on their first medication. Many will need additional treatment. Around a third of people with epilepsy fail to stop their seizures completely despite taking multiple medications. Lacosamide has been approved as an additional treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.
115	Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion in the review. They extracted data using a standardised data collection form and employed the QUADAS-2 tool to assess methodological quality. As not enough studies reported data at our prespecified halo threshold of 0.3 mm, we fitted hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) models to estimate US sensitivity and also to compare US with TAB. We graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.	"Two different researchers independently reviewed the studies to see if they met our criteria. They recorded the data using a standard form and used a tool called QUADAS-2 to assess how good the studies were.  Because not enough studies reported the data at the specific ""halo threshold"" we were looking for (0.3 mm), we used a statistical method called hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) models to estimate how well the ultrasound detected GCA. We also used this method to compare the ultrasound to the temporal artery biopsy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach."

116	For time to haemostasis, studies comparing collagen-based VCDs and extrinsic compression were too heterogeneous to be combined. However, both metal clip-based and suture-based VCDs were associated with reduced time to haemostasis when compared with extrinsic compression. For time to mobilisation, studies comparing VCDs with extrinsic compression were too heterogeneous to be combined. No difference was demonstrated in the incidence of vascular injury or mortality when VCDs were compared with extrinsic compression. No difference was demonstrated in the efficacy or safety of VCDs with different mechanisms of action. Further work is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of devices currently in use and to compare these with one other and extrinsic compression with respect to clearly defined outcome measures.	We couldn't combine the results of studies that compared collagen-based VCDs with manual or mechanical compression because the results were too different. However, both metal clip-based and suture-based VCDs were found to be associated with a shorter time to stop bleeding compared to manual or mechanical compression.  We couldn't combine the results of studies that compared time to start walking between VCDs and manual or mechanical compression because the results were too different.  We didn't find a difference in the number of blood vessel injuries or deaths between VCDs and manual or mechanical compression.  We also didn't find a difference in how well the different types of VCDs worked or how safe they were.  More research is needed to determine how well different types of VCDs work, and to compare them to each other and manual or mechanical compression, using clear outcome measures.	This study looked at different types of VCDs, which are devices that help prevent blood clots. The study found that both collagen-based VCDs and extrinsic compression were better at preventing blood clots. However, metal clip-based VCDs and suture-based VCDs were better at preventing blood clots compared to extrinsic compression. For time to mobilization, studies comparing VCDs and extrinsic compression were too different to combine. No difference in the incidence of vascular injury or death when VCDs were compared to extrinsic compression. No difference in the efficacy or safety of VCDs with different mechanisms of action. More research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of current devices and to compare them with one other and extrinsic compression in terms of clearly defined outcomes.
117	At least two review authors independently assessed search results, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included studies. We contacted study authors for additional information. We pooled data from trials with similar interventions and outcomes. We reported risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, using random-effects models unless there were fewer than four studies.	At least two experts looked at the search results, took notes from the studies, and checked how reliable each study was. We contacted the authors of the studies to get more information. We combined data from trials that used similar treatments and looked for similar results. We reported risk ratio for things that happened or didn't happen, and mean difference for things that could be measured, using random-effects models unless there were fewer than four studies.	We looked at studies that compared different treatments and outcomes. We combined data from studies that had similar outcomes. We reported the risk ratio (RR) for outcomes that were either positive or negative, and the mean difference (MD) for outcomes that were positive or negative. We used a statistical method called random-effects models unless there were fewer than four studies.
118	For the included trial, two review authors independently extracted data (e.g. number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, duration of oxygen therapy (hours), need for continuous positive airway pressure and need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, etc.) and assessed the risk of bias (e.g. adequacy of randomization, blinding, completeness of follow-up). The primary outcomes considered in this review were duration of oxygen therapy (hours), need for continuous positive airway pressure and need for mechanical ventilation.	For the study that was included, two researchers looked at the information from the study independently. They looked at things like the number of people in the study, the babies' birth weight, how old the babies were when they were born, how long they needed oxygen, and if they needed special breathing machines. They also looked at how well the study was designed and if there were any problems with the way it was done. The main things we were looking at were how long the babies needed oxygen, if they needed special breathing machines, and if they needed a type of breathing support called continuous positive airway pressure.	For each study we looked at, two researchers independently reviewed the data (e.g., the number of participants, birth weight, gestational age, duration of oxygen therapy (hours), need for continuous positive airway pressure and need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, etc.) and assessed the risk of bias (e.g., adequacy of randomization, blinding, completeness of follow-up). The main outcomes we looked at were duration of oxygen therapy (hours), need for continuous positive airway pressure and need for mechanical ventilation.
119	We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE from inception to March 2014. We handsearched conference abstracts from the last two meetings (2011 and 2012) of relevant societies in the field. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, Novartis clinical trials database (www.novctrd.com), Roche clinical trial protocol registry (www.roche-trials.com), Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials for ongoing trials.	We looked for studies on this topic in several databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE, starting from the very beginning and going up to March 2014.

121	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common eye disease and leading cause of sight loss worldwide. Despite its high prevalence and increasing incidence as populations age, AMD remains incurable and there are no treatments for most patients. Mounting genetic and molecular evidence implicates complement system overactivity as a key driver of AMD development and progression. The last decade has seen the development of several novel therapeutics targeting complement in the eye for the treatment of AMD. This review update encompasses the results of the first randomised controlled trials in this field.	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common eye disease that causes vision loss worldwide. It's getting more common as people live longer, and there's no cure for it. Many studies show that a part of the immune system called the complement system is overactive in AMD. Recently, scientists have developed new treatments that target this system to help with AMD. This review is about the first studies that tested these new treatments in people.	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common eye disease that causes vision loss worldwide. Even though it's becoming more common and more common as people get older, AMD is still treatable and there are no treatments for most people. There's growing evidence that the eye's natural defense system, called complement, is overactive. Over the past decade, scientists have developed new treatments that target complement in the eye to treat AMD. This review updates the results of the first randomized controlled trials in this field.
122	We included three new RCTs for this update, for a total of six included RCTs involving 559 children aged from 29 days to 12 years with pneumonia who were treated as inpatients. Pneumonia severity was described as moderate in one trial, severe in two trials, and was not stated in three trials. The studies assessed five different interventions: effects of conventional chest physiotherapy (3 studies, 211 children), positive expiratory pressure (1 study, 72 children), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (1 study, 94 children), bubble CPAP (bCPAP) (1 study, 225 children), and assisted autogenic drainage (1 studies, 29 children). The included studies were conducted in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, and South Africa. The studies were overall at low risk of bias. Blinding of participants was not possible in most studies, but we considered that the outcomes were unlikely to be influenced by the lack of blinding. One study of bCPAP reported that three deaths occurred in children in the physiotherapy group (N = 79), and 20 deaths in the control group (N = 146) (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.90; 225 children; low-quality evidence). One study of assisted autogenic drainage (N = 29), and one study of conventional chest physiotherapy (N = 72) reported no deaths occurred. It is uncertain whether chest physiotherapy techniques (bCPAP, assisted autogenic drainage, and conventional chest physiotherapy) reduced hospital stay duration (days) (mean difference (MD) 0.10, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.76; 4 studies; low-quality evidence). There was variation among clinical parameters used to define clinical resolution. Two small studies found no difference in resolution of fever between children in the physiotherapy (conventional chest physiotherapy and assisted autogenic drainage) and control groups. Of five studies that considered peripheral oxygen saturation levels, only two reported that use of chest physiotherapy (CPAP and conventional chest physiotherapy) showed a greater improvement in peripheral oxygen saturation levels. However, it was unclear whether respiratory rate (breaths/min) improved after conventional chest physiotherapy (MD -2.25, 95% CI -5.17 to 0.68; 2 studies, 122 children; low-quality evidence). Two studies assessed adverse events (number of events), but only one study reported any events (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.67; 2 studies, 254 children; low-quality evidence).	We looked at six different studies involving 559 children with pneumonia who were treated in the hospital. These studies used different methods to help clear the lungs, such as special breathing techniques and machines.  While we found some evidence that these techniques might help with certain things like breathing and oxygen levels, the studies were too small and varied to be sure.  We also found that some of these techniques might be linked to a lower chance of death.  However, more research is needed to confirm these findings.	This study looked at the effects of different types of chest physiotherapy for children with pneumonia. The study included 559 children from Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, and South Africa. The study found that some types of chest physiotherapy (like CPAP, CPAP, bubble CPAP, and assisted autogenic drainage) might help reduce hospital stays. However, the study also found that there wasn't enough evidence to say for sure if these chest physiotherapy treatments helped reduce hospital stays. The study also found that there wasn't enough evidence to say for sure if chest physiotherapy helped reduce the number of days children spent in the hospital. More research is needed to understand the long-term effects of chest physiotherapy on children with pneumonia.
123	The number of surgical techniques for decompression and solid interbody fusion as treatment for cervical spondylosis has increased rapidly, but the rationale for the choice between different techniques remains unclear. To determine which technique of anterior interbody fusion gives the best clinical and radiological outcomes in patients with single- or double-level degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine. We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2009), EMBASE (1980 to May 2009), BIOSIS (2004 to May 2009), and references of selected articles. Randomised comparative studies that compared anterior cervical decompression and interbody fusion techniques for participants with chronic degenerative disc disease. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Back Review Group criteria. Data on demographics, intervention details and outcome measures were extracted onto a pre-tested data extraction form. Thirty-three small studies ( 2267 patients) compared different fusion techniques. The major treatments were discectomy alone, addition of an interbody fusion procedure (autograft, allograft, cement, or cage), and addition of anterior plates. Eight studies had a low risk of bias. Few studies reported on pain, therefore, at best, there was very low quality evidence of little or no difference in pain relief between the different techniques. We found moderate quality evidence for these secondary outcomes: no statistically significant difference in Odom's criteria between iliac crest autograft and a metal cage (6 studies, RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.99 to1.24)); bone graft produced more effective fusion than discectomy alone (5 studies, RR 0.22 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.48)); no statistically significant difference in complication rates between discectomy alone and iliac crest autograft (7 studies, RR 1.56 (95% CI 0.71 to 3.43)); and low quality evidence that iliac crest autograft results in better fusion than a cage (5 studies, RR 1.87 (95% CI 1.10 to 3.17)); but more complications (7 studies, RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.92)). When the working mechanism for pain relief and functional improvement is fusion of the motion segment, there is low quality evidence that iliac crest autograft appears to be the better technique. When ignoring fusion rates and looking at complication rates, a cage has a weak evidence base over iliac crest autograft, but not over discectomy alone. Future research should compare additional instrumentation such as screws, plates, and cages against discectomy with or without autograft.	There are many different ways to operate on the neck to relieve pressure on nerves and fuse bones together to treat a condition called cervical spondylosis. However, it's not clear which method is best. This study aimed to find out which type of surgery, called anterior interbody fusion, works best for people with single or double-level degenerative disc disease in their necks. The researchers looked at studies that compared different fusion techniques. They found that while some methods, like using bone grafts from the hip, might lead to better fusion, they also come with a higher risk of complications. Using a metal cage, on the other hand, might be less risky but might not lead to as good fusion.  More research is needed to compare different surgical tools and techniques to determine the best approach for treating this condition.	Doctors are trying to figure out which type of surgery is best for people with cervical spondylosis, a condition that affects the cervical spine. There are two main types of surgery: decompression and solid interbody fusion. There are many different techniques available, but it's not clear which one is best. We looked at studies that compared these two types of surgery for people with cervical spondylosis. We found that there wasn't much difference in pain relief between the two types of surgery. However, there was some evidence that a bone graft called iliac crest autograft might be better than a metal cage for fusion, but it might cause more complications. Overall, we need more research to figure out which type of surgery is best for people with cervical spondylosis.
124	The myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) comprises a diverse group of haematopoietic stem cell disorders. Due to symptomatic anaemia, most people with MDS require supportive therapy including repeated red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. In combination with increased iron absorption, this contributes to the accumulation of iron resulting in secondary iron overload and the risk of organ dysfunction and reduced life expectancy. Since the human body has no natural means of removing excess iron, iron chelation therapy, i.e. the pharmacological treatment of iron overload, is usually recommended. However, it is unclear whether or not the newer oral chelator deferasirox leads to relevant benefit.	Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a condition where blood stem cells don't work properly. This can lead to anemia, which means you don't have enough red blood cells.  People with MDS often need blood transfusions to help with anemia.  But too many transfusions can lead to iron overload, which can damage your organs and shorten your life.  There is no way to get rid of extra iron naturally, so doctors usually recommend iron chelation therapy to remove it.  However, it's not clear if a newer type of iron chelation drug called deferasirox is really helpful.	Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of blood disorders that affect stem cells. Many people with MDS have anemia, which means they don't get enough red blood cells. To help them, they often need regular blood transfusions. This increases the amount of iron in their blood, leading to a buildup of iron, which can cause problems with their organs and reduce their life expectancy. Since the body doesn't have a natural way to remove excess iron, doctors usually recommend a treatment called iron chelation therapy. However, it's not clear if the newer oral chelator deferasirox is a good treatment for iron overload.
125	There is a high and increasing prevalence of intellectual impairments among children and adolescents in the West. Many countries offer personal assistance in the form of individualised support for people living in the community by a paid assistant other than a healthcare professional for at least 20 hours per week. To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents with intellectual impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on others, compared to other interventions. Electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Dissertation Abstracts International and a variety of specialist Swedish databases were searched from 1980 to June 2005; reference lists were checked; 345 experts, organisations, government bodies and charities were contacted in an attempt to locate relevant research. Children and adolescents with intellectual impairments (0-18 years) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (e.g., bathing and eating) and participate in normal activities due to permanent impairments. Controlled studies of personal assistance in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes were included. Titles and abstracts were examined by two reviewers. Outcome data were extracted. Studies were assessed for the possibility of bias. Results and potential sources of bias are presented for included studies. One included study randomised 1002 participants to personal assistance or usual care. Whilst personal assistance was generally preferred over other services, some people prefer other models of care. This review indicates that personal assistance may have some benefits for some recipients and may benefit caregivers. However, near complete dependence on proxy respondents raises concerns about the validity of these results. Paid assistance probably substitutes for informal care and may cost government more than alternatives; however, the total costs to recipients and society are currently unknown. Research in this field is limited. When implementing new programmes, recipients could be randomly assigned to different forms of assistance. While advocates may support personal assistance for myriad reasons, this review demonstrates that further studies are required to determine which models of personal assistance are most effective and efficient for particular people.	Many children and teenagers in Western countries are facing difficulties with learning and thinking.  To help them, many countries provide support in the form of personal assistants. These assistants are paid to help these individuals with everyday tasks, like getting dressed or eating, for at least 20 hours a week.  We wanted to see how helpful these personal assistants are and what impact they have on others, compared to other forms of help. We looked at studies from 1980 to 2005 and found that while personal assistants are generally preferred, some people prefer other types of support. Our review suggests that personal assistants may be beneficial for some people with learning difficulties and may also benefit their caregivers. However, we are concerned about the accuracy of the results because most of the information came from people who were closely related to the individuals with learning difficulties. Paid assistants may take the place of unpaid help from family and friends, and they may be more expensive than other options. The total cost to the people with learning difficulties and society is still unknown. We need more research to understand which types of support are best and most cost-effective for different people.	This study looked at how well personal assistance works for children and teenagers with intellectual disabilities in the West. These children often need help with everyday tasks like bathing and eating. Many countries offer personal assistance by a paid assistant, other than a healthcare professional, for at least 20 hours per week. The researchers wanted to see if this type of assistance is effective and if it helps others. They searched for studies that compared personal assistance to other types of care. They found one study that randomly assigned 1002 people to either receive personal assistance or usual care. While most people preferred personal assistance over other services, some people prefer other types of care. The study found that personal assistance may have some benefits for some people and may benefit caregivers. However, the study relied heavily on proxy respondents, which raises concerns about the validity of these findings. Personal assistance probably replaces informal care and may cost the government more than alternatives. However, the total cost to recipients and society is unknown. More research is needed to understand which types of personal assistance are most effective and efficient for each person.
126	Four small randomised controlled trials involving 728 allocated/224 analysed participants met our inclusion criteria. These trials had a high risk of bias. Drug companies sponsored two of the trials. We were unable to pool the data due to the heterogeneity in outcome definitions and the different antibiotics used. The included trials compared the following antibiotic schedules. The first trial compared quinolone (levofloxacin) plus standard treatment (anti-staphylococcal penicillin (cloxacillin or dicloxacillin), aminoglycoside (tobramycin or netilmicin) and rifampicin) versus standard treatment alone reporting uncertain effects on all-cause mortality (8/31 (26%) with levofloxacin plus standard treatment versus 9/39 (23%) with standard treatment alone; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.56, very low quality evidence). The second trial compared daptomycin versus low-dose gentamicin plus an anti-staphylococcal penicillin (nafcillin, oxacillin or flucloxacillin) or vancomycin. This showed uncertain effects in terms of cure rates (9/28 (32.1%) with daptomycin versus 9/25 (36%) with low-dose gentamicin plus anti-staphylococcal penicillin or vancomycin, RR 0.89 95% CI 0.42 to 1.89; very low quality evidence). The third trial compared cloxacillin plus gentamicin with a glycopeptide (vancomycin or teicoplanin) plus gentamicin. In participants receiving gentamycin plus glycopeptide only 13/23 (56%) were cured versus 11/11 (100%) receiving cloxacillin plus gentamicin (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.85; very low quality evidence). The fourth trial compared ceftriaxone plus gentamicin versus ceftriaxone alone and found no conclusive differences in terms of cure (15/34 (44%) with ceftriaxone plus gentamicin versus 21/33 (64%) with ceftriaxone alone, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.10; very low quality evidence). The trials reported adverse events, need for cardiac surgical interventions, uncontrolled infection and relapse of endocarditis and found no conclusive differences between comparison groups (very low quality evidence). No trials assessed septic emboli or quality of life.	We looked at four small studies that tested different antibiotics for treating a serious heart infection called infective endocarditis. The studies had some serious problems, and two of them were funded by drug companies. The studies used different antibiotics and measured different outcomes, so we couldn't combine their results. Overall, the studies didn't show any clear benefit of one antibiotic over another for treating this infection. They also didn't find any clear differences in side effects, the need for heart surgery, or infection coming back.	This study looked at different antibiotics used to treat a type of bacteria called staphylococcus aureus. They found that some antibiotics, like levofloxacin, gentamicin, daptomycin, glycopeptide, and ceftriaxone, might help cure staphylococcus aureus, but the evidence is not very strong. The study also found that some antibiotics, like quinolone, levofloxacin, aminoglycoside, tobramycin, netilmicin, and rifampicin, might help cure staphylococcus aureus, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.
127	The purpose of low-vision rehabilitation is to allow people to resume or to continue to perform daily living tasks, with reading being one of the most important. This is achieved by providing appropriate optical devices and special training in the use of residual-vision and low-vision aids, which range from simple optical magnifiers to high-magnification video magnifiers.	Low vision rehabilitation helps people with vision problems keep doing everyday things, like reading. This is done by giving them special glasses and training them to use different aids that make seeing easier, like magnifying glasses or video magnifiers.	Low-vision rehabilitation aims to help people with low vision recover or continue to do everyday tasks, with reading being one of the most important. This is achieved by providing appropriate optical devices and special training in the use of residual-vision and low-vision aids, which range from simple optical magnifiers to high-magnification video magnifiers.
128	We found no evidence from randomised controlled trials on allograft transplantation or drilling. The very low quality evidence from RCTs comparing mosaicplasty with microfracture is insufficient to draw conclusions on the relative effects of these two interventions for treating isolated cartilage defects of the knee in adults. Of note is that treatment failure, with recurrence of symptoms, occurred with both procedures. Further research is needed to define the best surgical option for treating isolated cartilage defects. We suggest the greatest need is for multi-centre RCTs comparing reconstructive procedures (mosaicplasty versus allograft transplantation) for large osteochondral lesions and reparative procedures (microfracture versus drilling) for small chondral lesions.	We looked at studies that compared different treatments for damaged cartilage in the knee.  We found that none of these studies were good enough to tell us which treatment is best. Both treatments we looked at, mosaicplasty and microfracture, had problems with the symptoms coming back. We need more research to figure out the best way to fix damaged cartilage.  We think that bigger studies that compare different types of surgery for different sizes of damage are what we need most.	We didn't find any evidence from studies comparing allograft transplantation or drilling for treating isolated cartilage defects in the knee in adults. The evidence from studies comparing mosaicplasty with microfracture is not very strong. We need more research to figure out the best surgical option for treating isolated cartilage defects. We suggest that more research is needed to compare reconstructive procedures (mosaicplasty versus allograft transplantation) for large osteochondral lesions and reparative procedures (microfracture versus drilling) for small chondral lesions.
129	We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, with additional searches conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization Portal/ICTRP to 16 September 2020. There were no language or date restrictions applied to the electronic searches, and no methodological filters were used to restrict the search.	We searched a lot of different databases and websites to find research studies about delirium, which is a condition where people get confused and have trouble thinking clearly. We looked at studies published in different languages and from different years, without any special filters.	We searched several large databases of medical research, including ALOIS, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization Portal/ICTRP, up to September 16, 2020. We didn't limit our search by language or date, and we didn't use any special filters to narrow our search.
130	Prophylactic IM or IV injections of ergot alkaloids may be effective in reducing blood loss, reducing PPH (estimated blood loss of at least 500 mL), and increasing maternal haemoglobin. Ergot alkaloids may also decrease the use of therapeutic uterotonics, but adverse effects may include elevated blood pressure and pain after birth requiring analgesia. There were no differences between groups in terms of other adverse effects (vomiting, nausea, headache or eclamptic fit). There is a lack of evidence on the effects of ergot alkaloids on severe PPH, and retained or manual removal of placenta. There is also a lack of evidence on the oral route of administration of ergot alkaloids.	Giving injections of ergot alkaloids after childbirth can help reduce blood loss, decrease the risk of excessive bleeding after childbirth, and increase the level of red blood cells in mothers after childbirth.  Ergot alkaloids can also reduce the need for other medications to stop bleeding. However, ergot alkaloids can increase blood pressure and cause pain requiring pain medication. It was found that ergot alkaloids didn't seem to affect the likelihood of vomiting, nausea, headaches, or seizures.  The study did not find enough evidence on the effects of ergot alkaloids on very severe bleeding after childbirth, the likelihood of the placenta being stuck inside the womb, or the need for a manual removal of the placenta.  Additionally, the study found little evidence on the effects of ergot alkaloids when taken orally.	Ergot alkaloids are a type of medicine that can be given to pregnant women. They can help reduce blood loss, reduce the amount of blood in the mother's blood, and increase the amount of hemoglobin in the mother's blood. Ergot alkaloids may also help reduce the use of uterine medications, but they can cause side effects like high blood pressure and pain after birth. There was no difference between the groups in terms of other side effects like vomiting, nausea, headache, or eclamptic fit. There is a lack of evidence on the effects of ergot alkaloids on severe blood loss, retained or manual removal of placenta. There is also a lack of evidence on the oral route of giving ergot alkaloids.
131	We used standard Cochrane review methodology. One author initially screened all references, and excluded any that were clearly irrelevant or duplicates. Two authors then independently screened all abstracts of articles, identified by the review search strategy, for relevancy. Two authors independently assessed the full text of all potentially relevant articles for eligibility, completed the data extraction and assessed the studies for risk of bias using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool.

132	Clinical practice does not always reflect best practice and evidence, partly because of unconscious acts of omission, information overload, or inaccessible information. Reminders may help clinicians overcome these problems by prompting them to recall information that they already know or would be expected to know and by providing information or guidance in a more accessible and relevant format, at a particularly appropriate time. This is an update of a previously published review.	Doctors don't always follow the best practices and recommendations even though they know what is best for their patients. This can happen because they forget important information, get overwhelmed with information, or have trouble accessing the information they need. Reminders can help doctors overcome these challenges by prompting them to remember things they already know or by providing them with information in a way that is easy to understand and use at the right time. This is an updated version of a previous review on the same topic.	Doctors sometimes don't always follow the best practices and evidence. This is partly because of unconscious mistakes, information overload, or inaccessible information.

133	The evidence from RCTs undertaken to date does not support vision screening for older people living independently in a community setting, whether in isolation or as part of a multi-component screening package. This is true for screening programmes involving questions about visual problems, or direct measurements of visual acuity. The most likely reason for this negative review is that the populations within the trials often did not take up the offered intervention as a result of the vision screening and large proportions of those who did not have vision screening appeared to seek their own intervention. Also, trials that use questions about vision have a lower sensitivity and specificity than formal visual acuity testing. Given the importance of visual impairment among older people, further research into strategies to improve vision of older people is needed. The effectiveness of an optimised primary care-based screening intervention that overcomes possible factors contributing to the observed lack of benefit in trials to date warrants assessment; trials should consider including more dependent participants, rather than those living independently in the community.	There's no evidence from studies that checking eyesight helps older people living on their own, whether it's done alone or as part of a larger health check. This is true even when the check involves asking about vision problems or directly testing eyesight. The main reason for this is that many people in these studies didn't take advantage of the eyesight check, and many of those who didn't get the check still sought help for their vision on their own. Also, tests that ask about vision problems are less accurate than formal eyesight tests. Since vision problems are important for older people, more research is needed to find better ways to improve their eyesight. We need to study if a better eyesight check done in a primary care setting can help, and the studies should include people who need more help, not just those living independently.	This study looked at how to help older people who live independently in their own homes improve their vision. The study found that there isn't enough evidence to say that vision screening is helpful for older people living in their own homes. This is especially true for screening programs that ask about vision problems or measure how well people can see. The most likely reason for this is that the people in the studies didn't use the screening program, and many people who didn't use the screening didn't seek their own help. Also, studies that ask about vision have a lower accuracy and specificity than formal visual acuity tests. Given how important it is for older people to have trouble seeing, more research is needed to find ways to improve their vision. We need to figure out the best way to screen for vision problems in older people living independently in a community setting. These studies should include more people who live independently, rather than those living independently in the community.
134	We included all studies that evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of amylase in the drain fluid at 48 hours or more for the diagnosis of pancreatic leak in people who had undergone pancreatic resection excluding total pancreatectomy. We planned to exclude case-control studies because these studies are prone to bias, but did not find any. At least two authors independently searched and screened the references produced by the search to identify relevant studies.	We only included studies that looked at the drain fluid test at 48 hours or more after surgery to see if there was a leak in the pancreas. We planned to exclude studies that compared people with and without leaks because these studies can be biased, but we didn't find any. Two people independently checked the studies we found to make sure they were relevant.

135	Sixty-seven studies involving 3427 participants met the eligibility criteria. Thirty-six studies involving 2239 participants were included in meta-analyses. Follow-up for clinical outcomes ranged between 0.3 and 52.8 weeks (median 5 weeks). Interventions included relaxation techniques, exercise, acupressure, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), educational interventions, benzodiazepine treatment, dopaminergic agonists, telephone support, melatonin, reflexology, light therapy, different forms of peritoneal dialysis, music, aromatherapy, and massage. Incomplete reporting of key methodological details resulted in uncertain risk of bias in many studies. In very low certainty evidence relaxation techniques had uncertain effects on sleep quality and duration, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), depression, anxiety, and fatigue. Studies were not designed to evaluate the effects of relaxation on sleep latency or hospitalisation. Exercise had uncertain effects on sleep quality (SMD -1.10, 95% CI -2.26 to 0.05; I2 = 90%; 5 studies, 165 participants; very low certainty evidence). Exercise probably decreased depression (MD -9.05, 95% CI -13.72 to -4.39; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 46 participants; moderate certainty evidence) and fatigue (SMD -0.68, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.29; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 107 participants; moderate certainty evidence). Compared with no acupressure, acupressure had uncertain effects on sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scale 0 - 21) (MD -1.27, 95% CI -2.13 to -0.40; I2 = 89%; 6 studies, 367 participants: very low certainty evidence). Acupressure probably slightly improved sleep latency (scale 0 - 3) (MD -0.59, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.27; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 173 participants; moderate certainty evidence) and sleep time (scale 0 - 3) (MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.12 to -0.09; I2 = 68%; 3 studies, 173 participants; moderate certainty evidence), although effects on sleep disturbance were uncertain as the evidence certainty was very low (scale 0 - 3) (MD -0.49, 95% CI -1.16 to 0.19; I2 = 97%). In moderate certainty evidence, acupressure probably decrease fatigue (MD -1.07, 95% CI -1.67 to -0.48; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 137 participants). Acupressure had uncertain effects on depression (MD -3.65, 95% CI -7.63 to 0.33; I2 = 27%; 2 studies, 137 participants; very low certainty evidence) while studies were not designed to evaluate the effect of acupressure on HRQoL, anxiety, or hospitalisation. It was uncertain whether acupressure compared with sham acupressure improved sleep quality (PSQI scale 0 to 21) because the certainty of the evidence was very low (MD -2.25, 95% CI -6.33 to 1.82; I2 = 96%; 2 studies, 129 participants), but total sleep time may have been improved (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.73 to 0.04; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 107 participants; low certainty evidence). 2 =2 =There were no studies designed to directly examine and/or correlate efficacy of any interventions aimed at improving sleep that may have been attempted for the spectrum of sleep disordered breathing. No studies reported treatment effects for children. Adverse effects of therapies were very uncertain.	Researchers looked at 67 studies involving 3427 people to see if different treatments could help with sleep problems. They found that some treatments might help, but more research is needed.  Relaxation techniques might improve sleep quality and reduce depression, anxiety, and tiredness, but the evidence wasn't strong enough to be sure. Exercise may improve sleep quality, depression, and tiredness, but again, the evidence isn't strong enough to be sure. Acupressure, a type of pressure point massage, might also improve sleep quality, sleep latency (time it takes to fall asleep), and sleep time, but the evidence is uncertain.  Acupressure might also help with tiredness.  However, there's not enough evidence to say for sure if these treatments work. They also didn't look at whether these treatments affect hospital stays or quality of life. There weren't any studies that looked at how these treatments affect sleep problems related to breathing. No studies looked at how these treatments affect children.  Finally, it's unclear if these treatments have any side effects.	This study looked at the effects of different relaxation techniques, exercise, acupressure, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), educational interventions, benzodiazepines, dopaminergic agonists, telephone support, melatonin, reflexology, light therapy, different types of peritoneal dialysis, music, aromatherapy, and massage on people with sleep problems. The study found that relaxation techniques had uncertain effects on sleep quality and duration, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), depression, anxiety, and fatigue. Exercise probably decreased depression, anxiety, and fatigue. The study also found that acupressure might slightly improve sleep latency and sleep time, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.
136	We included two RCTs that randomised 20 participants to NPPV and 20 participants to control. We assessed both studies as having high risk of bias; both trials assessed effects of bilateral positive airway pressure (BiPAP). Neither trial used continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Controls received standard care. Investigators reported no deaths and no serious adverse events (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE): very low quality of evidence due to serious risk of bias and serious imprecision of results). Both trials showed a statistically significant reduction in symptom score. One trial did not report a standard deviation (SD), but by using an estimated SD, we found a statistically significantly reduced asthma symptom score (mean difference (MD) -2.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.70 to -0.30, P = 0.03, 19 participants, GRADE: very low quality of evidence). In the other trial, NPPV was associated with a lower total symptom score (5.6 vs 1.9, 16 participants, very low quality of evidence) before cross-over, but investigators did not report an SD, nor could it be estimated from the first phase of the trial, before the cross-over. These gains could be clinically relevant, as a reduction of three or more points in symptom score is considered a clinically meaningful change. Researchers documented five dropouts (12.5%), four of which were due to intolerance to NPPV, and one to respiratory failure requiring intubation. Owing to insufficient reporting in the latter trial and use of different scoring systems, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis nor a Trial Sequential Analysis.	This study looked at two different trials that tested a treatment called NPPV in people with breathing problems. NPPV is a type of breathing support. Both trials had some serious flaws, so we can't be completely sure about the results. However, both trials showed that NPPV helped reduce symptoms in some people. One trial showed that people who used NPPV had a statistically significant reduction in their asthma symptoms, which means it was more than likely that the improvement wasn't due to chance. However, the other trial didn't provide enough details to confirm the findings.  Unfortunately, not enough information was available to combine the results of both trials.	This study looked at two different ways to help people with asthma. One way is called bilateral positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and the other is called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The study found that NPPV can significantly reduce asthma symptoms. One way is called bilateral positive airway pressure (BiPAP), but the other way is called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The study also found that NPPV might be associated with a lower overall asthma symptom score, but the evidence was not very strong. The study also found that some people stopped participating in the study because they were unable to tolerate NPPV, and some had breathing problems.
137	We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 6), along with OVID MEDLINE, six other databases and four trial registries with no language or date restrictions.

138	Bisphosphonates are considered to be the treatment of choice for people with Paget's disease of bone. However, the effects of bisphosphonates on patient-centred outcomes have not been extensively studied. There are insufficient data to determine whether reducing and maintaining biochemical markers of bone turnover to within the normal range improves quality of life and reduces the risk of complications.	Bisphosphonates are considered the best treatment for people with Paget's disease of bone. However, we don't know enough about how these drugs affect people's overall well-being. We need more research to see if reducing the signs of bone breakdown improves people's quality of life and lowers their chances of complications.

139	Plasmodium vivax liver stages (hypnozoites) may cause relapses, prolonging morbidity, and impeding malaria control and elimination. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends three schedules for primaquine: 0.25 mg/kg/day (standard), or 0.5 mg/kg/day (high standard) for 14 days, or 0.75 mg/kg once weekly for eight weeks, all of which can be difficult to complete. Since primaquine can cause haemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, clinicians may be reluctant to prescribe primaquine without G6PD testing, and recommendations when G6PD status is unknown must be based on an assessment of the risks and benefits of prescribing primaquine. Alternative safe and efficacious regimens are needed.	Malaria can come back even after treatment because of a dormant stage of the parasite that lives in the liver. This can make people sick again and makes it harder to control and eliminate malaria. The World Health Organization recommends different ways to take a medicine called primaquine to prevent this, but these can be difficult to follow. Primaquine can also cause problems for people with a certain genetic condition. Doctors are often hesitant to prescribe it without testing for this condition, and they have to carefully weigh the risks and benefits of using it.  There is a need for new and safer ways to prevent malaria from coming back.	Plasmodium vivax liver stages (hypnozoites) can cause relapses, prolong illness, and hinder malaria control and elimination.

140	Early neonatal hyperglycemia is common among very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates. Increased risks for death and major morbidities have been observed among VLBW neonates who develop hyperglycemia. It is uncertain whether the hyperglycemia per se is a cause of adverse clinical outcomes or whether the incidence of adverse outcomes can be reduced by treatment. To assess the effects on clinical outcomes of interventions for treating neonatal hyperglycemia in the VLBW neonate receiving total or partial parenteral nutrition. We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4 of 12, 2011), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2011), EMBASE (1980 to April 2011) and CINAHL (1982 to July 2008). We searched for abstracts submitted for the annual meetings of Pediatric Academic Societies 2000 to 2011 and The European Society for Pediatric Research 2005 to 2010. Randomized or quasi-randomized trials of interventions for the treatment of hyperglycemia in hyperglycemic VLBW neonates were eligible for inclusion in this review. Two review authors independently selected studies for eligibility and extracted data on study design, methodology, clinical features, and treatment outcomes. Additional information on study design and outcomes was obtained from the lead investigator of each of the two included trials. The included trials were assessed for blinding of randomization, blinding of caretakers to the intervention, completeness of follow-up, and blinding of outcome measurement. The treatment effect measures for categorical outcomes were relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI); for continuous outcomes the measure was mean difference and 95% CI. Only two eligible trials were found (Collins 1991; Meetze 1998). Both were randomized but of very small size (24 and 23 neonates randomized in each trial, respectively). No trial compared reduction versus no reduction of glucose infusion. Collins 1991 compared insulin infusion with standard care. Insulin infusion had no significant effect on death or bacterial sepsis; effects on other major morbidities were not assessed. Insulin infusion resulted in significant increases in non-protein energy intake, glucose intake, and short-term weight gain. Meetze 1998 compared insulin infusion with reduction of glucose infusion. Insulin infusion had no significant effects on death, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, bacterial sepsis, fungal sepsis, or necrotizing enterocolitis; effects on other major morbidities were not assessed. Insulin infusion resulted in significant increases in glucose intake and total energy intake. Evidence from randomized trials in hyperglycemic VLBW neonates is insufficient to determine the effects of treatment on death or major morbidities. It remains uncertain whether the hyperglycemia per se is a cause of adverse clinical outcomes or how the hyperglycemia should be treated. Much larger randomized trials in hyperglycemic VLBW neonates that are powered on clinical outcomes are needed in order to determine whether, and how, the hyperglycemia should be treated.	This study is about babies born very early and weighing very little (very low birth weight or VLBW). These babies often have high blood sugar (hyperglycemia). We don't know if this high blood sugar itself causes problems or if it's just a sign of something else going wrong.  The study looked at whether treating high blood sugar in these babies helps to avoid complications.  Researchers searched for studies that compared different treatments for high blood sugar in these babies.  They found two studies, both small, that looked at giving insulin to lower blood sugar.  Neither study showed that giving insulin prevented death or serious problems.  We need much larger studies to determine if treating high blood sugar is helpful and how best to treat it.	This study looked at different ways to treat high blood sugar in very low birth weight (VLBW) babies. These babies often have high blood sugar, which can make them more likely to die or have serious health problems. The researchers wanted to see if giving these babies insulin (a type of sugar) before they are born could help them. They searched for studies that compared giving insulin to not giving it. They found only two studies (Collins 1991 and Meetze 1998) that met their criteria. They found that giving insulin didn't have a significant effect on death or infections, but it did lead to a significant increase in non-protein energy intake, glucose intake, and short-term weight gain. More research is needed to understand the best way to treat hyperglycemia in very low birth weight babies.
141	There is insufficient evidence to determine whether drainage of functional ovarian cysts prior to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation influences rates of live birth, clinical pregnancy, number of follicles recruited, or number of oocytes collected in women with a functional ovarian cyst. The findings of this review do not provide supportive evidence for this approach, particularly in view of the requirement for anaesthesia, extra cost, psychological stress and risk of surgical complications.	We don't know if draining fluid from a common type of ovarian cyst before fertility treatment helps women get pregnant. We looked at many studies, but none showed a clear benefit. This is because draining the cyst requires anesthesia, is expensive, can be stressful, and might cause complications.	We don't have enough evidence to say whether draining functional ovarian cysts before controlled ovarian hyperstimulation affects rates of live birth, clinical pregnancy, number of follicles recruited, or number of oocytes collected in women with functional ovarian cysts. The findings don't support this approach, especially considering the need for anaesthesia, extra cost, psychological stress, and risk of surgical complications.
142	Massage and touch have been suggested as a non-pharmacological alternative or supplement to other treatments offered in order to reduce or manage a range of conditions associated with dementia such as anxiety, agitated behaviour and depression. It has also been suggested that massage and touch may counteract cognitive decline. To assess the effects of a range of massage and touch therapies on conditions associated with dementia, such as anxiety, agitated behaviour and depression, identify any adverse effects, and provide recommendations about future trials. We identified trials from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 12 July 2005 using the terms massage, reflexology, touch and shiatsu. This Register contains records from all major healthcare databases and many ongoing trials databases and is updated regularly. In addition, general and specific literature databases were searched and patient and therapist organizations contacted. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which a massage or touch intervention was given to persons suffering from dementia of any type, compared with other treatments or no treatment, and in which effect parameters included measures of behavioural problems, caregiver burden, emotional distress or cognitive abilities, were eligible for inclusion. Furthermore, we employed a set of minimal methodological quality criteria as a selection filter. We identified 34 references in the initial searches. Of these, seven were actual or possible RCTs, but only two were found to meet the requirements of the set of minimal methodological criteria. The very limited amount of reliable evidence available is in favour of massage and touch interventions for problems associated with dementia. However, this evidence addresses only two specific applications: hand massage for the immediate or short-term reduction of agitated behaviour, and the addition of touch to verbal encouragement to eat for the normalization of nutritional intake. The existing evidence does not support general conclusions about the effect or possible side effects of such interventions. No severe side effects were identified. Massage and touch may serve as alternatives or complements to other therapies for the management of behavioural, emotional and perhaps other conditions associated with dementia. More research is needed, however, to provide definitive evidence about the benefits of these interventions.	People have suggested that massage and touch can be used as an alternative or a way to help other treatments for dementia. These treatments can help with anxiety, agitation, and depression, and it has also been suggested that they could help slow down cognitive decline. We reviewed studies on massage and touch therapies for dementia to see if they actually work and to look for any possible side effects. We searched for studies that were done in a way that allowed us to trust their results. After looking at 34 studies, we found that only two met our standards. This means we don't have a lot of reliable evidence to show that massage and touch really help people with dementia. However, the few studies we found suggest that hand massages might help reduce agitation in the short-term, and touching people while encouraging them to eat might help them eat more. We did not find any serious side effects from massage and touch. It is possible that these therapies could be used as an alternative or in addition to other treatments for dementia, but we need more research to be sure.	Massage and touch have been suggested as a non-drug alternative or supplement to other treatments for people with dementia, such as anxiety, agitated behavior, and depression. It has also been suggested that massage and touch might counteract cognitive decline. This study looked at the effects of massage and touch on conditions associated with dementia, such as anxiety, agitated behavior, and depression. The study found that there isn't a lot of reliable evidence to support massage and touch for these problems. However, there are two specific examples: hand massage for immediate or short-term reduction of agitated behavior, and the addition of touch to verbal encouragement to eat for normalizing nutritional intake. The study didn't find any serious side effects. Overall, massage and touch might be helpful alternatives or complements to other therapies for managing behavioral, emotional, and perhaps other conditions associated with dementia. However, more research is needed to provide definitive evidence about the benefits of these interventions.
143	A fall on the outstretched arm can result in an elbow fracture. Loss of elbow function is a common problem with these fractures and can have major implications for functional capabilities. It is unknown whether early mobilisation can improve functional outcome without increasing complications. To compare the effects (benefits and harms) of early mobilisation versus delayed mobilisation of the elbow after elbow fractures in adults. We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (August 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2010), EMBASE (1980 to August 2010), CINAHL (1982 to June 2010), PEDro (31 May 2010), and ongoing trials registers (April 2010). We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating early mobilisation of the elbow joint after elbow fracture in adults. Two authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. There was no pooling of data. We included one trial reporting outcome at follow-up times ranging between two and 47 months for 81 participants with Mason type 1 and 2 radial head fractures. This poorly-reported trial was at particular high risk of detection and reporting biases. The trial found no significant differences between early and delayed mobilisation in the numbers of participants with pain or limitations in their range of elbow motion. All participants were reported as being able to use their arms for full activities of daily living and none had changed their occupation or lifestyle. There was no mention of fracture complications. There is a lack of robust evidence to inform on the timing of mobilisation, and specifically on the use of early mobilisation, after non-surgical or surgical treatment for adults with elbow fractures. There is a need for high quality, well-reported, adequately powered, randomised controlled trials that compare early versus delayed mobilisation in people with commonly-occurring elbow fractures, treated with or without surgery. Trials should use validated upper limb function scales, and assessment should be both short-term (to monitor recovery and early complications) and long-term (at least one year).	A broken elbow is a common injury that can happen when you fall on your outstretched arm. It can be hard to use your arm after a broken elbow, which can make it difficult to do everyday things. Doctors want to know if starting movement right away after the injury helps people recover better than waiting a little while to start moving. They looked at studies to compare the two approaches. They found only one study that was done well enough to be helpful. This study looked at people who had a specific type of broken elbow and found that there was no difference between starting movement right away and waiting a little while. However, this study was small and didn't look at all types of broken elbows. More research is needed to figure out the best way to help people recover from broken elbows.	A fall on the outstretched arm can lead to a broken elbow. This can make it hard for people to move their arms, which can make it hard for them to do everyday tasks. We wanted to see if moving the elbow early after a broken elbow can help people move their arms better without causing more problems. We looked at studies that compared early movement to delayed movement in adults with broken elbows. We found one study that had problems with how it was done, so we can't be sure about the results. The study didn't find any clear difference between early movement and delayed movement in the number of people with pain or limitations in their elbow movement. All participants were able to use their arms for everyday activities, and none had changed their jobs or lifestyle. We didn't find any mention of any complications from the broken elbow. We need more high-quality studies that compare early movement to delayed movement in adults with common elbow fractures. These studies should use standardized upper limb function scales, and the results should be measured in the short term (to monitor recovery and early complications) and in the long term (at least one year).

145	Three review authors independently extracted data, which were cross-checked by other team members. Outcomes were mortality, costs, quality of life, and aneurysm rupture. For mortality, we estimated risk ratios (RR) (endovascular aneurysm repair only), hazard ratios (HR) (open repair only), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on Mantel-Haenszel Chi2 statistics at one and six years (open repair only) following randomisation.	A group of three doctors looked at the information from the studies. They each looked at the information on their own and then they all talked about it together.  They wanted to see if the treatments caused deaths, cost a lot of money, affected people's quality of life, or made the aneurysm burst. To look at death rates, we calculated some special numbers called risk ratios and hazard ratios. We also looked at how often the aneurysm burst over one and six years.	This study looked at how long people lived, how much it cost, their quality of life, and if their aneurysm ruptured. They looked at things like death, costs, quality of life, and aneurysm rupture. For death, they calculated risk ratios (RR) for endovascular aneurysm repair only, hazard ratios (HR) for open repair only, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on Mantel-Haenszel Chi2 statistics at one and six years after randomization.
146	There is very low- to moderate-certainty evidence supporting the use of maintenance agonist pharmacotherapy for pharmaceutical opioid dependence. Methadone or buprenorphine did not differ on some outcomes, although on the outcomes of retention and self-reported substance use some results favoured methadone. Maintenance treatment with buprenorphine appears more effective than non-opioid treatments. Due to the overall very low- to moderate-certainty evidence and small sample sizes, there is the possibility that the further research may change these findings.	There's evidence suggesting that using methadone or buprenorphine for opioid addiction is helpful, but the evidence is not very strong. While methadone might be slightly better at helping people stay in treatment and report less opioid use, the difference isn't huge. Buprenorphine seems to work better than other treatments that don't use opioids. However, because the evidence is not very strong and the studies were small, more research is needed to be sure.	This study looked at the use of a medication called maintenance agonist pharmacotherapy for people who are addicted to opioid medications. The study found that there is very little to moderate evidence supporting the use of maintenance agonist pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence. Methadone or buprenorphine didn't seem to affect some outcomes, but some results suggested methadone. Buprenorphine seems to be more effective than non-opioid treatments. Because the evidence is very weak and the study was small, there is a possibility that future research might change these findings.
147	Failure of implantation and conception may result from an inability of the blastocyst to escape from its outer coat, which is known as the zona pellucida. Artificial disruption of this coat is known as assisted hatching and has been proposed as a method for improving the success of assisted conception by facilitating embryo implantation. To determine the effect of assisted hatching (AH) of embryos from assisted conception on live birth and multiple pregnancy rates. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (August 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to August 2012). Three authors identified and independently screened trials. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of AH (mechanical, chemical or laser disruption of the zona pellucida prior to embryo replacement) versus no AH that reported live birth or clinical pregnancy. Three authors independently performed quality assessments and data extraction. Thirty-one trials reported clinical pregnancy data, including 1992 clinical pregnancies in 5728 women. There was no significant difference in the odds of live birth in the AH group compared with the control group (9 RCTs; odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.26, moderate quality evidence), with no evidence of significant heterogeneity (P = 0.38) or inconsistency (I2 = 6%). Analysis of the clinical pregnancy rates from the nine studies which reported live birth showed a non-significant result (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.25 ). Analysis of all of the studies included in this update (31 RCTs) showed that the clinical pregnancy rate in women who underwent AH was slightly improved, but the level only just reached statistical significance (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.27, moderate quality evidence). However, it is important to note that the heterogeneity for this combined analysis for clinical pregnancy rate was statistically significant (P = 0.001) and the I2 was 49%. Subgroup analysis of women who had had a previous failed attempt at IVF found improved clinical pregnancy rates in the women undergoing AH compared with the women in the control group (9 RCTs, n = 1365; OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.81) with I2 = 20%. Miscarriage rates per woman were similar in both groups (14 RCTs; OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.54, P = 0.90, moderate quality evidence). Multiple pregnancy rates per woman were significantly increased in women who were randomised to AH compared with women in the control groups (14 RCTs, 3447 women; OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.70, P = 0.004, low quality evidence). This update has demonstrated that whilst assisted hatching (AH) does appear to offer a significantly increased chance of achieving a clinical pregnancy, the extent to which it may do so only just reaches statistical significance. The'take home' baby rate was still not proven to be increased by AH. The included trials provided insufficient data to investigate the impact of AH on several important outcomes. Most trials still failed to report on live birth rates.	Sometimes, a baby can't get implanted in the mother's womb because it's trapped inside a protective shell called the zona pellucida.  A procedure called assisted hatching helps the baby break free from this shell and increase the chances of a successful pregnancy. This study looked at 31 different studies to see if assisted hatching really helped couples have babies. The researchers found that while assisted hatching may slightly improve the chances of getting pregnant, it doesn't guarantee a live birth.  It also slightly increased the chance of having twins or triplets.  More research is needed to fully understand how assisted hatching affects pregnancy outcomes.	This study looked at whether a method called assisted hatching (AH) could help women who have had a failed attempt at fertilization (IVF) get pregnant. AH involves removing the embryo's outer layer, which is called the zona pellucida, to make it easier for the embryo to be implanted. The study found that AH didn't make a big difference in the chances of having a live birth or having multiple pregnancies. However, AH did slightly improve the chances of having multiple pregnancies in women who had had a previous failed IVF attempt. The study also found that women who had AH had a slightly higher chance of having multiple pregnancies compared to women who didn't have AH. However, the study didn't find a clear difference in the chances of having multiple pregnancies in women who had AH compared to women who didn't have AH.
148	We included five trials in the review, with 190 participants in total. We did not identify any new studies for inclusion from the updated search in January 2016. Three trials were related to dental treatment, i.e. restorative and extraction treatments; two trials related to orthodontic treatment. We did not judge any of the included trials to be at low risk of bias. Three of the included trials compared paracetamol with placebo, only two of which provided data for analysis (presence or absence of parent-reported postoperative pain behaviour). Meta-analysis of the two trials gave arisk ratio (RR) for postoperative pain of 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.22; two trials, 100 participants; P = 0.31), which showed no evidence of a benefit in taking paracetamol preoperatively (52% reporting pain in the placebo group versus 42% in the paracetamol group). One of these trials was at unclear risk of bias, and the other was at high risk. The quality of the evidence is low. One study did not have any adverse events; the other two trials did not mention adverse events. Four of the included trials compared ibuprofen with placebo. Three of these trials provided useable data. One trial reported no statistical difference in postoperative pain experienced by the ibuprofen group and the control group for children undergoing dental treatment. We pooled the data from the other two trials, which included participants who were having orthodontic separator replacement without a general anaesthetic, to determine the effect of preoperative ibuprofen on the severity of postoperative pain. There was a statistically significant mean difference in severity of postoperative pain of -13.44 (95% CI -23.01 to -3.88; two trials, 85 participants; P = 0.006) on a visual analogue scale (0 to 100), which indicated a probable benefit for preoperative ibuprofen before this orthodontic procedure. However, both trials were at high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence is low. Only one of the trials reported adverse events (one participant from the ibuprofen group and one from the placebo group reporting a lip or cheek biting injury).	We reviewed five studies with a total of 190 participants. The studies looked at whether taking paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen before dental procedures helped reduce pain. We found that paracetamol didn't seem to have much effect on pain. Ibuprofen, however, showed a possible benefit in reducing pain for children getting orthodontic treatment (braces). However, the quality of the evidence was low because of some problems with the way the studies were done.	This study looked at whether taking ibuprofen before orthodontic treatment helps reduce pain after surgery. They found that ibuprofen might help reduce pain after surgery, but the quality of the evidence is low. The study also found that ibuprofen might help reduce pain after surgery, but the quality of the evidence is low.
149	We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (accessed via Ovid from 1966 to July 2012), EMBASE (accessed via Ovid, from 1980 to July 2012), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS), the Chinese Biological Medicine Database (CBM, 1978 to July 2012), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI, 1980 to July 2012) and the Chinese scientific periodical database VIP Information (VIP, 1989 to July 2012). There was no language restriction in searching for studies.	We looked for research studies in a bunch of different medical databases, like the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences, the Chinese Biological Medicine Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the Chinese scientific periodical database VIP Information. We didn't limit our search to any particular language.

150	We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), randomised trials, cluster RCTs or cluster randomised trials of real-time video counselling for current tobacco smokers from any setting that measured smoking cessation at least six months following baseline. The real-time video counselling intervention could be compared with a no intervention control group or another smoking cessation intervention, or both.	We included studies that were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), randomised trials, cluster RCTs or cluster randomised trials that looked at real-time video counselling for people who currently smoke. These studies had to be done in any setting and had to measure whether people quit smoking at least six months after they started the study. The real-time video counselling could be compared to a group that didn't get any help, or another type of smoking cessation intervention, or both.	We looked at studies where people who smoke cigarettes were given real-time video counseling to help them quit smoking for at least six months after starting the program. These videos could be compared to a group that didn't get the video counseling, another group that didn't get the video counseling, or both.
151	We included 11 trials from our systematic search, with 191 participants meeting our inclusion criteria; three of these trials had three treatment arms. Eight trials compared short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists to placebo and four trials compared short-acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists to placebo. Three trials compared short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists to short-acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists. All were cross-over trials with only small numbers of participants. We were only able to enter data into the analysis from three trials comparing short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists to placebo. Short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists versus placebo All eight trials (six single-dose trials and two longer-term trials) reporting on this comparison reported on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), either as per cent predicted (% predicted) or L. We were able to combine the data from two trials in a meta-analysis which showed a greater per cent change from baseline in FEV1 L after beta-2 agonists compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 6.95%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 12.02; 2 trials, 82 participants). Only one of the longer-term trials reported on exacerbations, as measured by hospitalisations and courses of antibiotics. Only the second longer-term trial presented results for participant-reported outcomes. Three trials narratively reported adverse events, and these were all mild. Three single-dose trials and the two longer trials reported on forced vital capacity (FVC), and five trials reported on peak expiratory flow, i.e. forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF25-75). One trial reported on airway clearance in terms of sputum weight. We judged the certainty of evidence for each of these outcomes to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. Short-acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists versus placebo All four trials reporting on this comparison looked at the effects of ipratropium bromide, but in different doses and via different delivery methods. One trial reported FEV1% predicted; three trials measured this in L. Two trials reported adverse events, but these were few and mild. One trial reported FVC and three trials reported FEF25-75. None of the trials reported on quality of life, exacerbations or airway clearance. We judged the certainty of evidence for each of these outcomes to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short-acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists on any of the outcomes we assessed. Short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists versus short-acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists None of the three single-dose trials reporting on this comparison provided data we could analyse. The original papers from three trials report that both treatments lead to an improvement in FEV1 L. Only one trial reported on adverse events; but none were experienced by any participant. No trial reported on any of our other outcomes. We judged the certainty of evidence to be very low, meaning we are very uncertain about the effect of short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists compared to short-acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists on any of the outcomes we assessed.	We looked at 11 studies with 191 people who met our criteria. Some studies had three different treatments, and others compared two treatments. We compared two types of inhalers: one that helps open up the airways (beta-2 agonists) and one that helps relax the airways (muscarinic antagonists). We also compared these inhalers to a fake treatment (placebo). All studies involved switching back and forth between treatments, and only had a small number of people. We could only analyze data from three studies that compared beta-2 agonists to placebo. Overall, we found that beta-2 agonists might improve lung function compared to placebo, but we are very unsure because the studies were small and we only had limited data. We also found that the other types of inhalers might have similar effects, but we are also very unsure about this.	This study looked at whether a type of medicine called short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists (beta-2 agonists) helps people breathe better. They found that short-acting beta-2 agonists were better than a fake medicine (placebo). However, they didn't find enough evidence to say for sure if short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists are better than a fake medicine (placebo). The study also found that short-acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists were better than a fake medicine (placebo). They also found that short-acting inhaled muscarinic antagonists were better than a fake medicine (placebo) at reducing lung inflammation. However, they didn't find enough evidence to say for sure if short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists are better than a fake medicine (placebo). They also didn't find enough evidence to say for sure if short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonists are better than a fake medicine (placebo) at reducing lung inflammation.
152	Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. If required, we contacted study authors to request additional data. We performed meta-analyses using random-effects modelling. We carried out sensitivity analyses for the quality of included studies and performed subgroup analyses based on setting, study design, dominant intervention components, and region.	"Two researchers reviewed the quality of the studies and collected information. They reached out to the authors of the studies if they needed more details.  They then used a specific method called ""random-effects modelling"" to analyze the results of multiple studies together.  They also checked how reliable the results were based on the quality of the studies and looked at different subgroups based on things like where the studies were done, the type of study, and what the treatment involved."	Two researchers independently looked at the quality of the studies and collected information from them. If they needed more information, they contacted the authors of the studies to ask for more information. We combined the results of the studies using a statistical method called meta-analysis. We also analyzed the quality of the studies based on the setting, the study design, the main components of the intervention, and the region where the study was conducted.
153	Preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) before 26 weeks can delay lung development and can cause pulmonary hypoplasia, as a result of oligohydramnios. Restoring the amniotic fluid volume by transabdominal amnioinfusion might prevent abnormal lung development and might have a protective effect for neurological complications, fetal deformities and neonatal sepsis. To assess the effectiveness of transabdominal amnioinfusion in improving perinatal outcome in women with oligohydramnios secondary to rupture of fetal membranes before 26 weeks. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2013). All randomised controlled trials comparing transabdominal amnioinfusion with no transabdominal amnioinfusion. Cluster- or quasi-randomised trials were not eligible for inclusion. In cases where only an abstract was available, we attempted to find the full articles. Two review authors assessed trials for inclusion. No eligible trials were identified. There are no included studies. There is currently no evidence to evaluate the use of transabdominal amnioinfusion in women with oligohydramnios secondary to rupture of fetal membranes before 26 weeks for improving perinatal outcome. Further research examining the effects of this intervention is needed. Two randomised controlled trials are ongoing but final data have not yet been published.	When a pregnant woman's water breaks before 26 weeks, it can cause problems with the baby's lungs developing properly. This is because the baby's lungs need to grow in a bath of amniotic fluid, and when the water breaks, this fluid can leak out, leading to a lack of fluid around the baby. To help with this, doctors sometimes try to replace the lost fluid by putting it back into the woman's womb through a procedure called transabdominal amnioinfusion. We wanted to see if this procedure actually helps babies born early, but we couldn't find any studies that looked at this specifically. This means we don't have enough evidence to say whether or not transabdominal amnioinfusion is helpful for babies born early with low amniotic fluid. There are currently two studies going on, but the results haven't been published yet.	This study looked at whether giving fluid to the baby's lungs (transabdominal amnioinfusion) after a rupture of the baby's membranes (oligohydramnios) before 26 weeks can help prevent problems with lung development. The researchers searched for studies that compared giving fluid to the baby's lungs (transabdominal amnioinfusion) to not giving fluid. They found no studies that met their criteria. More research is needed to see if giving fluid to the baby helps improve the baby's health. Two studies are ongoing, but the final results haven't been published yet.
154	Incentive spirometry (IS) is a treatment technique that uses a mechanical device to reduce pulmonary complications during postoperative care. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007. Update the previously published systematic review to compare the effects of IS for preventing postoperative pulmonary complications in adults undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). We searched CENTRAL and DARE on The Cochrane Library (Issue 2 of 4 2011), MEDLINE OVID (1948 to May 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 20 2011), LILACS (1982 to July 2011), the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) (1980 to July 2011), Allied & Complementary Medicine (AMED) (1985 to May 2011), CINAHL (1982 to May 2011). Randomised controlled trials comparing IS with any type of prophylactic physiotherapy for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications in adults undergoing CABG. Two reviewers independently evaluated trial quality using the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and extracted data from included trials. For continuous outcomes, we used the generic inverse variance method for meta-analysis and for dichotomous data we used the Peto Odds Ratio. This update included 592 participants from seven studies (two new and one that had been excluded in the previous review in 2007. There was no evidence of a difference between groups in the incidence of any pulmonary complications and functional capacity between treatment with IS and treatment with physical therapy, positive pressure breathing techniques (including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB), active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) or preoperative patient education. Patients treated with IS had worse pulmonary function and arterial oxygenation compared with positive pressure breathing. Based on these studies there was no improvement in the muscle strength between groups who received IS demonstrated by maximal inspiratory pressure and maximal expiratory pressure. Our update review suggests there is no evidence of benefit from IS in reducing pulmonary complications and in decreasing the negative effects on pulmonary function in patients undergoing CABG. In view of the modest number of patients studied, methodological shortcomings and poor reporting of the included trials, these results should still be interpreted cautiously. An appropriately powered trial of high methodological rigour is needed to determine if there are patients who may derive benefit from IS following CABG.	This study looked at whether a device called an Incentive Spirometer (IS) helps people who have had heart surgery (CABG) avoid lung problems.  The study reviewed other research on the topic, including some new studies.  They found that using IS didn't make any difference in the number of lung problems people had.  In fact, using IS might even make lung function worse compared to other methods of breathing exercises.  More research is needed to figure out if IS could be helpful for some people after CABG.	This study looked at whether a new treatment called incentive spirometry (IS) helps people who have had a heart bypass surgery (CABG) breathe better. IS is a device that helps people breathe better. The researchers reviewed many studies that compared IS to other treatments like physical therapy, breathing techniques, or education before surgery. They found that there wasn't enough evidence to say whether IS is helpful for preventing lung problems after surgery. They also found that patients who received IS had worse lung function and oxygen levels compared to those who didn't. Overall, the researchers suggest that more research is needed to confirm these findings.
155	Inhaled anti-pseudomonal antibiotic treatment probably improves lung function and reduces exacerbation rate, but pooled estimates of the level of benefit were very limited. The best evidence is for inhaled tobramycin. More evidence from trials measuring similar outcomes in the same way is needed to determine a better measure of benefit. Longer-term trials are needed to look at the effect of inhaled antibiotics on quality of life, survival and nutritional outcomes.	Breathing in a certain type of antibiotic, called anti-pseudomonal, probably helps improve lung function and reduces the number of flare-ups in people with lung problems.  However, we don't have enough information to know how much it helps.  The most evidence we have is for the antibiotic tobramycin.  We need more studies that look at the same things in the same way to get a better idea of how much these antibiotics help.  We also need to study these antibiotics over a longer period of time to see how they affect people's quality of life, survival, and nutrition.	Inhaled anti-pseudomonal antibiotic treatment is likely to improve lung function and reduce the number of lung infections, but we don't have enough good evidence to say for sure. The best evidence is for inhaled tobramycin. We need more studies that measure similar outcomes in the same way to get a better understanding. We also need longer-term studies to look at the effects of inhaled antibiotics on quality of life, survival, and nutrition.
156	Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a common retinal vascular abnormality associated with conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, glaucoma, and a wide variety of hematologic disorders. Macular edema (ME) represents an important vision-threatening complication of CRVO. Intravitreal steroids (IVS), such as triamcinolone acetonide, have been utilized to treat macular edema stemming from a variety of etiologies and may be a treatment option for CRVO-ME.	Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a problem with the blood vessels in the eye that happens when blood can't flow properly in the central vein of the retina. It can happen to people who have other conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or glaucoma. CRVO can cause a serious problem called macular edema, which makes it hard to see. One way to treat macular edema is with medicine called intravitreal steroids (IVS), like triamcinolone acetonide. This medicine is injected into the eye and can help to reduce the swelling.	Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a common problem that affects the blood vessels in the retina. It's often caused by things like high blood pressure, diabetes, glaucoma, and other health problems. Macular edema (ME) is a serious eye problem caused by CRVO.

157	Given the low level of certainty about the effects of bubble CPAP versus other pressure sources on the risk of treatment failure and most associated morbidity and mortality for preterm infants, further large, high-quality trials are needed to provide evidence of sufficient validity and applicability to inform context- and setting-relevant policy and practice.	Because we are not completely sure about how bubble CPAP compares to other methods of helping babies breathe, we need more large and well-conducted trials to get a clearer picture. This will help us make better decisions about how to treat babies with breathing problems.	We don't know enough about the effects of bubble CPAP compared to other pressure sources on the risk of treatment failure and most associated health problems and deaths for premature babies. More large, high-quality studies are needed to provide evidence that bubble CPAP is reliable and applicable to inform policy and practice.
158	"The use of games as an educational strategy has the potential to improve health professionals' performance (e.g. adherence to standards of care) through improving their knowledge, skills and attitudes. The objective was to assess the effect of educational games on health professionals' performance, knowledge, skills, attitude and satisfaction, and on patient outcomes. We searched the following databases in January 2012: MEDLINE, AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Database of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, EPOC Register, ERIC, Proquest Dissertations & Theses Database, and PsycINFO. Related reviews were sought in DARE and the above named databases. Database searches identified 1546 citations. We also screened the reference lists of included studies in relevant reviews, contacted authors of relevant papers and reviews, and searched ISI Web of Science for papers citing studies included in the review. These search methods identified an additional 62 unique citations for a total of 1608 for this update. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT), controlled clinical trials (CCT), controlled before and after (CBA) and interrupted time-series analysis (ITS). Study participants were qualified health professionals or in postgraduate training. The intervention was an educational game with ""a form of competitive activity or sport played according to rules"". Using a standardized data form we extracted data on methodological quality, participants, interventions and outcomes of interest that included patient outcomes, professional behavior (process of care outcomes), and professional's knowledge, skills, attitude and satisfaction. The search strategy identified a total of 2079 unique citations. Out of 84 potentially eligible citations, we included two RCTs. The game evaluated in the first study used as a reinforcement technique, was based on the television game show ""Family Feud"" and focused on infection control. The study did not assess any patient or process of care outcomes. The group that was randomized to the game had statistically higher scores on the knowledge test (P = 0.02). The second study compared game-based learning (""Snakes and Ladders"" board game) with traditional case-based learning of stroke prevention and management. The effect on knowledge was not statistically different between the two groups immediately and 3 months after the intervention. The level of reported enjoyment was higher in the game-based group. The findings of this systematic review neither confirm nor refute the utility of games as a teaching strategy for health professionals. There is a need for additional high-quality research to explore the impact of educational games on patient and performance outcomes."	This study looked at whether using games to teach healthcare professionals could improve their skills, knowledge, and attitudes. They wanted to see if games would also lead to better patient outcomes. They looked at many different research studies to find out. The studies they found involved real healthcare professionals and those in training. They tested different kinds of games and how they affected the professionals' understanding of topics like infection control and stroke care.  Some of the games were based on popular TV shows, while others were like classic board games.  The results showed that games might help some professionals learn more, but the effects weren't always clear.  Overall, the study didn't have enough evidence to say for sure if games are a good way to teach healthcare professionals. More research is needed to understand how games can improve patient care.	"This study looked at how using games to teach healthcare professionals can improve their knowledge, skills, and attitudes. The researchers wanted to see if games could help healthcare professionals improve their performance by improving their knowledge, skills, and attitudes. They searched for studies that compared games to traditional learning methods. They found two studies. The first study used a game called ""Family Feud"" to teach healthcare professionals about infection control. The second study compared the game to traditional learning about stroke prevention and management. The results showed that the game-based learning didn't significantly improve knowledge, skills, or attitudes. However, the game-based learning group reported feeling more satisfied with their work. More research is needed to understand the effects of games on healthcare professionals' knowledge, skills, attitudes, and patient outcomes."
159	To address how oxygen therapy should be targeted in adults with ARDS (particularly ARDS secondary to COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses) and requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit, and the impact oxygen therapy has on mortality, days ventilated, days of catecholamine use, requirement for renal replacement therapy, and quality of life.	This study aims to determine how best to give oxygen to adults with ARDS, particularly those with ARDS caused by COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses. They're also looking at the impact of oxygen therapy on how long patients are on a ventilator, how long they need medication to help their heart, and if they need kidney dialysis. They want to see if oxygen therapy affects how long patients need to be on a ventilator, how long they need medications to help their heart, if they need kidney dialysis, and their overall quality of life.	This study aims to understand how oxygen therapy should be given to adults with ARDS (especially those with ARDS due to COVID-19 or other respiratory viruses) who need to be on a breathing machine in an intensive care unit. It also aims to understand how oxygen therapy affects mortality, how long people need to be on a breathing machine, how often they need to take catecholamines, how often they need renal replacement therapy, and their quality of life.
160	The evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis in cardiac and thoracic surgery is limited. Data for important outcomes such as pulmonary embolism or major bleeding were often lacking. Given the uncertainties around the benefit-to-risk balance, no conclusions can be drawn and a case-by-case risk evaluation of VTE and bleeding remains preferable.	We don't have enough clear evidence about the best ways to prevent blood clots in people having heart or chest surgery. Some important information about things like blood clots in the lungs or major bleeding is missing. Because of this lack of information, we can't make any strong recommendations. We have to carefully evaluate each patient's risk of blood clots and bleeding before making decisions about preventing them.	We don't have enough information about how effective and safe thromboprophylaxis is in heart and thoracic surgery. We don't have enough information about important outcomes like pulmonary embolism or major bleeding. We can't draw any conclusions because we don't know the best way to balance the benefits and risks. We recommend a case-by-case risk assessment of VTE and bleeding.
161	On 27 November 2022, we searched CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP with no limitations to language, date, document type, or publication status. Any type of formal or informal educational intervention, lasting for any time, that had content focused directly on knowledge about IBD or skills needed for direct management of IBD or its symptoms was included. Delivery methods included face-to-face or remote educational sessions, workshops, guided study via the use of printed or online materials, the use of mobile applications, or any other method that delivers information to patients.	We searched through several medical databases and websites to find studies on educational programs for people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We were interested in any program that taught people about IBD or how to manage their symptoms. These programs could be delivered in person or online, using a variety of methods, such as workshops, online materials, mobile apps, or other ways to share information.	We looked for information about IBD in several medical databases, including CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP.

162	An anthracycline infusion duration of six hours or longer reduces the risk of clinical heart failure, and it seems to reduce the risk of subclinical cardiac damage. Since there is only a small amount of data for children and data obtained in adults cannot be extrapolated to children, different anthracycline infusion durations should be evaluated further in children. We identified no significant difference in the occurrence of clinical heart failure in participants treated with a doxorubicin peak dose of less than 60 mg/m2 or 60 mg/m2 or more. Only one RCT was available for the other identified peak doses, so we can make no definitive conclusions about the occurrence of cardiotoxicity. More high-quality research is needed, both in children and adults and in leukaemias and solid tumours.	Giving anthracycline for 6 hours or longer seems to help protect the heart from damage.  We don't have enough information about how long to give it to children, so more research is needed. We found no difference in heart problems when giving different amounts of doxorubicin, another medicine used to treat cancer. However, we only had one study on other medicines like this, so we can't say for sure how they affect the heart. We need more studies on both children and adults, and on different types of cancer.	This study looked at whether giving anthracycline for six hours or longer reduces the risk of heart failure. It also seems to reduce the risk of damage to the heart. The study found that giving anthracycline for six hours or longer didn't seem to make a difference in the risk of heart failure in people who received less than 60 mg/m2 or 60 mg/m2 or more. However, there was only one study that looked at the other doses of doxorubicin, so we can't say for sure if it caused heart problems. More high-quality research is needed, both in children and adults, and in people with leukemia and solid tumors.
163	The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March 2020. Vaccine development and deployment were swiftly prioritised as a method to manage and control disease spread. The development of an effective vaccine relies on people's participation in randomised trials. Recruitment to vaccine trials is particularly challenging as it involves healthy volunteers who may have concerns around the potential risks and benefits associated with rapidly developed vaccines.	The World Health Organization announced that COVID-19 was a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. To help stop the spread of the virus, scientists quickly worked on developing vaccines. To make sure these vaccines are safe and effective, we need people to volunteer for research studies called clinical trials.  It's not always easy to get people to participate in these trials because they might be worried about the possible risks of a new vaccine, especially one that was developed quickly.

164	Asthma is a respiratory (airway) condition that affects an estimated 300 million people worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits free serum immunoglobulin E (IgE). It is called an'anti-IgE' drug. IgE is an immune mediator involved in clinical manifestations of asthma. A recent update of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance in 2013 recommends omalizumab for use as add-on therapy in adults and children over six years of age with inadequately controlled severe persistent allergic IgE-mediated asthma who require continuous or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids.	Asthma is a breathing problem that affects around 300 million people worldwide. It can be very serious and even cause death.  Omalizumab is a medicine that works by blocking a substance called IgE, which is involved in causing asthma symptoms. It's sometimes used to help people with severe asthma that doesn't get better with other treatments, especially if they need to take steroid pills regularly.	Asthma is a lung condition that affects millions of people worldwide. It's linked to serious health problems and even death. Omalizumab is a medicine that blocks the immune system's ability to fight off asthma. It's called an 'anti-IgE' drug. IgE is a chemical in the body that can cause asthma symptoms. A recent update of NICE guidelines recommends using omalizumab as an additional treatment for adults and children over six years old who have severe asthma that needs constant or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids.
165	Two review authors independently selected the studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. They resolved disagreements by discussion with the rest of the review authors. We performed statistical analyses in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by The Cochrane Collaboration. The quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE methods. Primary outcomes were live birth and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) per couple randomised.	Two researchers independently looked at the studies, took out information, and assessed how likely it was that the study results were biased. If they disagreed, they talked about it with the other researchers. We analyzed the data according to the guidelines from the Cochrane Collaboration. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE methods. We were looking for how often couples had a baby or experienced a problem called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).	Two researchers independently reviewed the studies, collected data, and assessed the risk of bias. They discussed any disagreements with the other researchers. The quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE method. The main outcomes we looked at were live birth and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) per couple.
166	We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were the presence of normal olfactory function, serious adverse effects and change in sense of smell. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of parosmia, change in sense of taste, disease-related quality of life and other adverse effects (including nosebleeds/bloody discharge). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.	We looked at studies about treating loss of smell. We wanted to know if treatment could help people get their smell back, if it caused any serious problems, and how it changed people's sense of smell. We also looked at how often people had a strange change in their sense of smell, how it affected their ability to taste, and their overall quality of life. We carefully reviewed the evidence to make sure it was reliable.	We used a standard method called Cochrane methods to conduct our study. We were mainly interested in how well people could smell, if they had any serious side effects, and if they had a change in their sense of smell. We also looked at how common parosmia was, if people had a change in their taste, how the disease affected their quality of life, and if there were any side effects (like nosebleeds or bloody discharge). We used a system called GRADE to assess how certain we were about the evidence for each outcome.
167	Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with several chronic diseases, including erectile dysfunction (ED). The association of OSAS and ED is far more common than might be found by chance; the treatment of OSAS with non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy is associated with improvement of respiratory symptoms, and may contribute to the improvement of associated conditions, such as ED.	Sleep apnea is a condition where you stop breathing for short periods during sleep. It is linked to other health issues, including problems getting or keeping an erection (erectile dysfunction, or ED). Sleep apnea and ED often go together, and treating sleep apnea with a machine that helps you breathe (positive airway pressure therapy) can help both your breathing and your ED.	Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a condition that makes it hard to sleep. It's linked to many long-term health problems, including erectile dysfunction (ED). The connection between OSAS and ED is much more common than we might think. Treating OSAS with non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy can help improve breathing symptoms and may even help with other conditions like ED.
168	We included 12 studies: eight were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and four were before-and-after studies. Most included RCTs had a low risk of bias in most domains of the Cochrane'Risk of bias' tool. There was inconclusive evidence of an effect of Xpert MTB/RIF on all-cause mortality, both overall (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.05; 5 RCTs, 9932 participants, moderate-certainty evidence), and restricted to studies with six-month follow-up (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.22; 3 RCTs, 8143 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was probably a reduction in mortality in participants known to be infected with HIV (odds ratio (OR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.96; 5 RCTs, 5855 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether Xpert MTB/RIF has no or a modest effect on the proportion of participants starting tuberculosis treatment who had a successful treatment outcome (OR) 1.10, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.26; 3RCTs, 4802 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was also inconclusive evidence of an effect on the proportion of participants who were treated for tuberculosis (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.23; 5 RCTs, 8793 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The proportion of participants treated for tuberculosis who had bacteriological confirmation was probably higher in the Xpert MTB/RIF group (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.61; 6 RCTs, 2068 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The proportion of participants with bacteriological confirmation who were lost to follow-up pre-treatment was probably reduced (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85; 3 RCTs, 1217 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).	We looked at 12 studies about Xpert MTB/RIF, a test for tuberculosis. Eight were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), where people are randomly assigned to different treatment groups, and four were before-and-after studies. Most RCTs were judged to be reliable. We found that Xpert MTB/RIF might have a small effect on overall death rates, but it's not clear. However, it might reduce death rates in people with HIV. It's not clear if Xpert MTB/RIF improves the chances of successful tuberculosis treatment, but it probably does help more people get diagnosed and treated. We also found that it might lead to more accurate diagnoses and help stop people with tuberculosis from being lost to follow-up before treatment.	This study looked at whether a drug called Xpert MTB/RIF could help people with tuberculosis get better. They found that Xpert MTB/RIF might help reduce the number of people who die from tuberculosis, especially those who are infected with HIV. They also found that Xpert MTB/RIF might help reduce the number of people who get tuberculosis and the number of people who get treated for tuberculosis. They also found that Xpert MTB/RIF might help reduce the number of people who get tested for tuberculosis.
169	Most cases of stroke are caused by impairment of blood flow to the brain (ischaemia), which results in a reduction in available oxygen and subsequent cell death. It has been postulated that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) may reduce the volume of brain that will die by greatly increasing available oxygen, and it may further improve outcomes by reducing brain swelling. Some centres are using HBOT routinely to treat people with stroke. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2005.	Strokes happen when blood flow to the brain is blocked, causing brain cells to die.  A treatment called hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) aims to deliver extra oxygen to the brain, hoping to reduce brain damage and improve recovery. Some hospitals are already using HBOT for stroke patients. This review updates a previous one from 2005.	Most strokes are caused by problems with blood flow to the brain, which leads to a decrease in oxygen availability and cell death. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been suggested to reduce the amount of brain cells that will die by increasing oxygen availability. It may also improve outcomes by reducing swelling in the brain. Some hospitals are using HBOT routinely to treat stroke patients. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2005.
170	Based on the best currently available evidence,'antistaphylococcal cephalosporins' and'broad spectrum penicillins plus betalactamase inhibitors' may have similar efficacy at caesarean section when considering immediate postoperative infection, although we did not have clear evidence for several important outcomes. Most trials administered antibiotics at or after cord clamping, or post-operatively, so results may have limited applicability to current practice which generally favours administration prior to skin incision. We have no data on any infant outcomes, nor on late infections (up to 30 days) in the mother; these are important gaps in the evidence that warrant further research. Antimicrobial resistance is very important but more appropriately investigated by other trial designs.	Based on the best information we have, 'antistaphylococcal cephalosporins' (a type of antibiotic) and 'broad spectrum penicillins plus betalactamase inhibitors' (another type of antibiotic) might work equally well at preventing infections right after a C-section.  However, we don't have enough evidence to say for sure about many important things. Most of the studies gave antibiotics at or after the umbilical cord was cut or after the surgery, so the results might not apply to how doctors usually give antibiotics these days, which is before the incision. We don't have any information about the effects on babies or about infections that happen later (up to 30 days after the surgery) in the mothers. These are important things that need more research.  Antibiotic resistance is very important, but it's better studied using different research designs.	This study looked at whether two types of antibiotics, antistaphylococcal cephalosporins and broad spectrum penicillins plus betalactamase inhibitors, could be equally effective at C-sections for preventing infections immediately after surgery. However, we didn't have enough clear evidence for several important outcomes. Most studies used antibiotics before or after the cord clamping, or after surgery, so the results might not apply to current practice, which generally favors giving antibiotics before the skin incision. We don't have any data on any infant outcomes, nor on late infections (up to 30 days) in the mother; these are important gaps in the evidence that warrant further research. Antimicrobial resistance is very important, but more research is needed using other trial designs.
171	From the available evidence, we cannot determine whether or not preoperative analgesics are of benefit in paediatric dentistry for procedures under local anaesthetic. There is probably a benefit in using preoperative analgesics prior to orthodontic separator placement. The quality of the evidence is low. Further randomised clinical trials should be completed with appropriate sample sizes and well defined outcome measures.	We don't know if giving pain medication before dental procedures helps kids who are getting local anesthesia. It might help with putting in orthodontic separators, but we need more research. We need to do more studies with a good number of kids and clear goals to measure how well the medication works.	We don't know for sure if giving pain medicine before surgery is helpful for children's dentistry for procedures done under local anesthesia. There's probably a benefit in giving pain medicine before putting in a separator for orthodontics. However, the quality of the evidence is low. We need more studies with large groups of people and clear measures of how well the treatments work.
172	Our search was conducted initially in 2014 and updated in 2017, 2018 and 2020 (10 June). We identified 21,217 records and screened 14,244 records after duplicates were removed. We assessed 316 records in full text. We excluded 190 studies (193 records) with reasons and included 108 studies (111 records) in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. There were 11 studies (12 records) that we screened from the last search update and appeared eligible for a future analysis. We decided to enter these as awaiting classification. We stratified the analysis first by participant clinical status: apparently healthy and non-healthy populations. We then stratified by age and pregnancy status as: infants and children, adolescents, pregnant women, and adults. Iron deficiency We included 72 studies (75 records) involving 6059 participants. Apparently healthy populations Five studies screened for iron deficiency in people without apparent illness. In the general adult population, three studies reported sensitivities of 63% to 100% at the optimum cutoff for ferritin, with corresponding specificities of 92% to 98%, but the ferritin cutoffs varied between studies. One study in healthy children reported a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 77%. One study in pregnant women reported a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100%. Overall confidence in these estimates was very low because of potential bias, indirectness, and sparse and heterogenous evidence. No studies screened for iron overload in apparently healthy people. People presenting for medical care There were 63 studies among adults presenting for medical care (5042 participants). For a sample of 1000 subjects with a 35% prevalence of iron deficiency (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 85% specificity, there would be 315 iron-deficient subjects correctly classified as having iron deficiency and 35 iron-deficient subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron deficiency, leading to a 90% sensitivity. Thresholds proposed by the authors of the included studies ranged between 12 to 200 ug/L. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 50. Among non-healthy adults using a fixed threshold of 30 mg/L (nine studies, 512 participants, low-certainty evidence), the pooled estimate for sensitivity was 79% with a 95% confidence interval of (58%, 91%) and specificity of 98%, with a 95% confidence interval of (91%, 100%). The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 140, a relatively highly informative test. Iron overload We included 36 studies (36 records) involving 1927 participants. All studies concerned non-healthy populations. There were no studies targeting either infants, children, or pregnant women. Among all populations (one threshold for males and females; 36 studies, 1927 participants, very low-certainty evidence): for a sample of 1000 subjects with a 42% prevalence of iron overload (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 65% specificity, there would be 332 iron-overloaded subjects correctly classified as having iron overload and 85 iron-overloaded subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron overload, leading to a 80% sensitivity. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 8.	This study looked at how well blood tests can tell if someone has too much or too little iron in their body. The study was done in 2014 and updated several times since then. They looked at a lot of studies and found that blood tests are pretty good at detecting iron deficiency, especially in adults who are seeing a doctor for other reasons. However, the tests are not as good at detecting iron overload, and there isn't much research on how well they work in children or pregnant women.	This study looked at whether a medicine called ferritin can help prevent iron deficiency in people who aren't healthy. The study found that ferritin can detect iron deficiency in people who are healthy and those who aren't. The study also found that ferritin can detect iron deficiency in people who aren't healthy. However, the study didn't find enough evidence to say for sure if ferritin is a good treatment for iron deficiency in people who aren't healthy.
173	We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 8 June 2020), Embase (1980 to 8 June 2020), and CINAHL (1982 to 8 June 2020). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.

We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of articles we found for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials.	We looked for studies on this topic in several medical databases, including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of articles we found.
174	This review includes only one RCT, funded by the Australian Research Council; the University of Sydney International Development Fund; Douglas and Lola Douglas Scholarship on Child and Adolescent Health; Nadia Verrall Memorial Scholarship; and a James Kentley Memorial Fellowship. This study recruited 26 children aged 4 to 12 years, with mild to moderate CAS of unknown cause, and compared two interventions: the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme-3 (NDP-3); and the Rapid Syllable Transitions Treatment (ReST). Children were allocated randomly to one of the two treatments. Treatments were delivered intensively in one-hour sessions, four days a week for three weeks, in a university clinic in Australia. Speech pathology students delivered the treatments in the English language. Outcomes were assessed before therapy, immediately after therapy, at one month and four months post-therapy. Our review looked at one-month post-therapy outcomes only. A number of cases in each cohort had recommenced usual treatment by their speech and language pathologist between one month and four months post-treatment (NDP-3: 9/13 participants; ReST: 9/13 participants). Hence, maintenance of treatment effects to four months post-treatment could not be analysed without significant potential bias, and thus this time point was not included for further analysis in this review. We judged all core outcome domains to be low risk of bias. We downgraded the quality of the evidence by one level to moderate due to imprecision, given that only one RCT was identified. Both the NDP-3 and ReST therapies demonstrated improvement at one month post-treatment. For three outcomes the effect was marginally greater for NDP-3 than ReST: accuracy of production on treated words (NDP-3 mean difference (MD) = 36.0, ReST MD = 33.9; absolute MD = 2.1 between groups); speech production consistency, measured by 25 real words repeated three times using the inconsistency subtest of the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) test (NDP-3 MD = 11.1, ReST MD = 10.9; absolute MD = 0.2 between groups); and accuracy of connected speech, assessed by imitated word accuracy in connected speech of at least three word combinations (NDP-3 MD = 14.3, ReST MD = 11.5; absolute MD = 2.8 between groups). ReST (MD = 18.3) demonstrated a marginally greater effect than NDP-3 (MD = 18.2) for accuracy of production on non-treated words at one month post-treatment (absolute MD = 0.1 between groups). The study did not assess the outcome of functional communication.	"This research looked at two different therapies for children with speech problems called ""childhood apraxia of speech"" (CAS).  Both therapies helped the children improve their speech, but one therapy, called the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme-3 (NDP-3), seemed to help a little bit more than the other therapy called Rapid Syllable Transitions Treatment (ReST). The study was small, only including 26 children, and was done in Australia. The study only looked at how the children improved one month after the therapy ended, not how long the improvements lasted."	This study looked at two treatments for children with mild to moderate speech problems. They compared two treatments: the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme-3 (NDP-3) and the Rapid Syllable Transitions Treatment (ReST). The treatments were given in one-hour sessions, four days a week, for three weeks, in a university clinic in Australia. Speech pathologists gave the treatments in English. The study found that both the NDP-3 and ReST treatments improved speech production after a month. However, the results were not very reliable, so more research is needed.
175	Glucocorticoids are the mainstay for the treatment of croup. The existing evidence demonstrates that glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of croup in children. However, updating the evidence on their clinical relevance in croup is imperative. This is an update to a review first published in 1999, and updated in 2004, 2011, and 2018.	Glucocorticoids are the main treatment for croup. We know they are effective in treating croup in children. However, we need to update the evidence on their usefulness. This is a new version of a review that was first published in 1999, and updated in 2004, 2011, and 2018.	Croup is a serious condition that affects the skin. Doctors use special medicines called glucocorticoids to treat it. The evidence shows that glucocorticoids are effective in treating croup in children. However, it's important to update the evidence on their effectiveness in treating croup. This is an update to a review that was first published in 1999 and updated in 2004, 2011, and 2018.
176	Though promising data on the in vitro maturation (IVM) technique have been published, unfortunately there is still no evidence from properly conducted randomised controlled trials upon which to base any practice recommendations regarding IVM before in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Regarding our secondary outcomes, very low-quality evidence showed that clinical pregnancy was higher with IVM when compared to IVF, whereas the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was zero in both studies in both groups. We are awaiting the results of six ongoing trials and eagerly anticipate further evidence from good-quality trials in the field.	While some promising research has been published on the IVM technique, there is still no strong evidence from well-designed studies to make recommendations about using IVM before IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection for women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Looking at our secondary outcomes, we found very low-quality evidence suggesting that clinical pregnancy rates might be higher with IVM compared to IVF. However, neither study reported any cases of OHSS in either group. We are eagerly awaiting the results of six ongoing trials and hope for more high-quality research in this area.	This study looked at a new technique called in vitro maturation (IVM) for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). While some promising results have been published about IVM, there isn't enough good evidence from well-designed studies to recommend IVM before in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. We found that IVM was more likely to cause a pregnancy than IVF, while IVM didn't cause any problems with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. We are waiting for the results of six ongoing studies and are eagerly waiting for more good quality studies in this area.
177	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children and adolescents with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention and they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the psychostimulant most often prescribed, but the evidence on benefits and harms is uncertain. This is an update of our comprehensive systematic review on benefits and harms published in 2015.	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common problem that affects children and teenagers. Children with ADHD often have trouble focusing, are very active, and make impulsive decisions. Methylphenidate is a medicine often used to treat ADHD, but we don't know for sure if it helps or if it causes any harm. This review is an update of a previous review we published in 2015.	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common mental health problem in children. Many children and teenagers with ADHD struggle to pay attention and are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the most common medication used to help children with ADHD, but we don't know for sure if it helps or hurts them. This is an update of a previous review we did in 2015.
178	The outcomes assessed in the review were pain response (reactivity and regulation) and adverse events. The level of certainty in the evidence and risk of bias were based on the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE approach. We analysed the standardised mean difference (SMD) using the generic inverse variance method to determine effect sizes.	We looked at how well the different pain management methods worked by measuring how babies reacted to pain and how well they could manage their pain. We also looked for any side effects. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE approach to determine how confident we were in the evidence and how likely the studies were to be flawed. We calculated the effect size of each method by measuring the standardised mean difference (SMD) using the generic inverse variance method.	This study looked at how well pain relief works and if there are any side effects. We used a tool called the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. We also looked at the standardised mean difference (SMD) using the generic inverse variance method to see how big the effect was.
179	Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model for pair-wise comparisons and a frequentist network meta-analysis for combined estimates. We interpreted them according to Cochrane methods. We considered a minimally important difference of three points for the International Prostate Symptoms Score[IPSS]. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence.	We carefully looked at the available research studies. Two people independently checked the studies, collected information, and looked for any problems with the studies. We used a specific method to analyze the data and interpret the results. We also looked for a difference of at least three points in the IPSS (International Prostate Symptoms Score), as this is considered a meaningful difference. We used a method called GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence.	Two different people looked at the studies, collected information, and assessed how reliable the studies were. We used a statistical method called a random-effects model to compare the results of different studies and a frequentist network meta-analysis to combine the results. We interpreted the results using Cochrane methods. We considered a minimally important difference of three points for the International Prostate Symptoms Score[IPSS]. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.
180	Blood transfusion is used in patients with severe malarial anaemia, but risks adverse reactions, transmission of disease, and is complicated to organize in developing countries. This review evaluates the effects of routine blood transfusion for severe anaemia on death and adverse outcomes in malarious areas. We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (April 2010), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2010), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2010), EMBASE (1980 to April 2010), LILACS (April 2010), and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted researchers and organizations working in the field. Randomized and quasi-randomized trials of blood transfusion compared with conservative management in malaria-associated severe anaemia. Trials were identified and data extracted by a single reviewer (MM) and checked by a second (HS). Inclusion criteria were applied and data were extracted independently by both reviewers. Two randomized trials of 230 children were included. In the transfusion group, there was a non-significant tendency towards fewer deaths (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.70), but a trend towards more severe adverse events (RR 8.60, 95% CI 1.11 to 66.43). In one trial by Bojang (1997a) respiratory distress was less common and hospital stay was shorter in the transfusion group (MD 1.88 days, 95% CI 2.41 to 1.35). Subsequent need for urgent blood transfusion was less common in the transfusion group (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.68). Day 28 packed cell volume was less in the transfusion group (MD -1.34, 95% CI -2.57 to -0.11). There was no information on HIV or Hepatitis B virus transmission. There is insufficient data to be sure whether routinely giving blood to clinically stable children with severe anaemia in endemic malarious areas reduces death, or results in higher haematocrit measured at one month.	This study looks at whether giving blood transfusions to children with severe anemia in areas where malaria is common helps them live longer or have fewer problems. The researchers looked at studies that compared giving blood transfusions to just watching and waiting. They found two studies that included 230 children. The results showed that giving blood might slightly reduce the number of deaths, but it also seemed to increase the number of serious side effects. One study showed that children who received blood transfusions had less breathing difficulty and stayed in the hospital for a shorter time. They also needed blood transfusions less often in the future. However, the study didn't provide information about the transmission of HIV or Hepatitis B. Overall, there's not enough evidence to say for sure whether giving blood to these children helps them live longer or improves their blood levels a month later.	Blood transfusions are used to treat severe malarial anemia, but they can cause side effects, spread the disease, and are difficult to organize in developing countries. This study looked at whether giving blood regularly to children with severe anemia in malarious areas reduces deaths and adverse outcomes. The study found that giving blood regularly did not lead to fewer deaths, but it did lead to more serious side effects. In one study, giving blood regularly led to fewer respiratory distress and a shorter hospital stay. Giving blood regularly also reduced the need for urgent blood transfusions. There was no information on HIV or Hepatitis B virus transmission. Overall, there isn't enough evidence to say whether giving blood regularly to children with severe anemia in malarious areas reduces death or results in higher blood pressure at one month.
181	Low back pain (LBP) is associated with enormous personal and societal burdens, especially when it reaches the chronic stage of the disorder (pain for a duration of more than three months). Indeed, individuals who reach the chronic stage tend to show a more persistent course, and they account for the majority of social and economic costs. As a result, there is increasing emphasis on the importance of intervening at the early stages of LBP. According to the biopsychosocial model, LBP is a condition best understood with reference to an interaction of physical, psychological, and social influences. This has led to the development of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) programs that target factors from the different domains, administered by healthcare professionals from different backgrounds. This review is an update of a Cochrane Review on MBR for subacute LBP, which was published in 2003. It is part of a series of reviews on MBR for musculoskeletal pain published by the Cochrane Back and Neck Group and the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group.	Low back pain is a common problem that can have a big impact on people's lives, especially when it lasts for more than three months.  Chronic low back pain tends to be more persistent and accounts for a large part of the social and economic costs associated with this condition.  Therefore, it's important to address low back pain early on.  The biopsychosocial model suggests that low back pain is influenced by a combination of physical, psychological, and social factors.  This has led to the development of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) programs that target all these factors and are delivered by healthcare professionals from different fields.  This review is an update of a previous study on MBR for low back pain that lasted for 1 to 3 months.  It is part of a series of reviews on MBR for musculoskeletal pain.	Low back pain (LBP) is a serious problem that can be very difficult to manage, especially if it lasts for more than three months. People who have LBP for a long time are more likely to have it, and they are responsible for most of their social and economic costs. So, it's becoming more important to treat LBP early on. The biopsychosocial model says that LBP is caused by a combination of physical, mental, and social factors. This has led to the development of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) programs that focus on different factors and are administered by healthcare professionals from different backgrounds. This review is an update of a previous review on MBR for subacute LBP, which was published in 2003. It's part of a series of reviews on MBR for musculoskeletal pain published by the Cochrane Back and Neck Group and the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group.
182	Sickle cell disease is the most common hemoglobinopathy occurring worldwide and sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis is a complication long recognized in this population. Cholestatic liver diseases are characterized by impaired formation or excretion (or both) of bile from the liver. There is a need to assess the clinical benefits and harms of the interventions used to treat intrahepatic cholestasis in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.	Sickle cell disease is a common blood disorder, and a complication called sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis can affect the liver. This happens when the liver doesnâ€™t make or get rid of bile properly. We need to figure out if the treatments for this problem are helpful and safe for people with sickle cell disease. This review is an update of a previous one.	Sickle cell disease is a common blood disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It's called sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis, and it's a common complication in people with sickle cell disease. It's caused by a condition called sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis, where the liver doesn't produce enough bile. We need to understand the best ways to treat sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previous review.
183	Homeopathy involves the use, in dilution, of substances which cause symptoms in their undiluted form. It is one of the most widespread forms of complementary medicines and is also used to treat asthma. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of homeopathy in people with chronic stable asthma. We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Searches were current as of August 2007. Randomised trials of homeopathy for the treatment of stable chronic asthma, with observation periods of at least one week were included. Data extraction was undertaken by two reviewers. Trial quality was assessed by the reviewers. Six trials with a total of 556 people were included. These trials were all placebo-controlled and double-blind, but of variable quality. They used different homeopathic treatments which precluded quantitative pooling of results for the primary outcome. Standardised treatments in these trials are unlikely to represent common homeopathic practice, where treatment tends to be individualised. No trial reported a significant difference on validated symptom scales. There were conflicting results in terms of lung function between the studies. There has been only a limited attempt to measure a'package of care' effect (i.e., the effect of the medication as well as the consultation, which is considered a vital part of individualised homeopathic practice). An update search in August 2005 did not identify any new studies. There is not enough evidence to reliably assess the possible role of homeopathy in asthma. As well as randomised trials, there is a need for observational data to document the different methods of homeopathic prescribing and how patients respond. This will help to establish to what extent people respond to a'package of care' rather than the homeopathic intervention alone.	Homeopathy is a type of medicine where very diluted substances are used. These substances would cause symptoms if they were not diluted. Homeopathy is very popular and some people use it to treat asthma. Researchers wanted to see if homeopathy actually helps people with asthma that doesn't go away. They looked at studies where people with asthma were given homeopathy or a fake treatment. They found six studies with 556 people. All of these studies used fake treatments and didn't tell people if they were getting homeopathy or not.  The studies used different types of homeopathy treatments, so it was difficult to compare the results. The researchers found that no study showed a clear difference between homeopathy and the fake treatment in terms of how well people felt. The studies also had mixed results about how well people could breathe. It's hard to say how much the homeopathy itself helped because the studies didn't look at the whole experience of using homeopathy, which includes talking to a doctor.  Overall, there's not enough evidence to say if homeopathy works for asthma. More research is needed, including studies that look at how people respond to the whole process of using homeopathy.	This study looked at whether homeopathy helps people with asthma. Homeopathy is a type of medicine that uses diluted substances to treat symptoms. It's one of the most common forms of complementary medicines and is also used to treat asthma. We wanted to see if homeopathy could help people with asthma. We looked at six studies with a total of 556 people. These studies used different homeopathic treatments, which made it hard to combine the results of all the studies. We found that there wasn't enough evidence to say for sure if homeopathy helps people with asthma. We need more observational data to understand how different homeopathic treatments work and how patients respond to them. This will help us understand if homeopathy is a good treatment for asthma.
184	Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common and severe complication that affects 50% of people with diabetes. Painful DPN is reported to occur in 16% to 24% of people with diabetes. A complete and comprehensive management strategy for the prevention and treatment of DPN, whether painful or not, has not yet been defined. Research into treatment for DPN has been characterised by a series of failed clinical trials, with few noteworthy advances. Strategies that support peripheral nerve regeneration and restore neurological function in people with painful or painless DPN are needed. The amino acid acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) plays a role in the transfer of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for b-oxidation. ALC supplementation also induces neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects in the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, ALC supplementation targets several mechanisms relevant to potential nerve repair and regeneration, and could have clinical therapeutic potential. There is a need for a systematic review of the evidence from clinical trials.	Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common and serious problem that affects half of all people with diabetes.  It causes pain in about 16-24% of people with diabetes. We still don't know how to best prevent or treat DPN, whether it causes pain or not.  Research into DPN treatments has been disappointing, with few good results. We need new treatments that can help nerves grow back and restore function in people with painful or painless DPN. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) is an amino acid that helps move fatty acids into mitochondria, where they are broken down. ALC also protects and nourishes nerves in the body.  This means ALC could help repair and regrow nerves, and might be a good treatment for DPN.  We need to carefully review the evidence from clinical trials to see if this is true.	Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common and serious complication that affects 50% of people with diabetes. Painful DPN is reported to occur in 16% to 24% of people with diabetes. We don't yet have a complete and comprehensive plan for preventing and treating DPN, whether painful or not. Research into treating DPN has been characterized by a series of failed clinical trials, with few notable advances. Strategies that support peripheral nerve regeneration and restore neurological function in people with painful or painless DPN are needed. The amino acid acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) plays a role in the transfer of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for b-oxidation. ALC supplementation also induces neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects in the peripheral nervous system. Therefore, ALC supplementation targets several mechanisms relevant to nerve repair and regeneration, and could potentially have clinical therapeutic potential. We need a systematic review of the evidence from clinical trials.
185	We included four randomised controlled trials, representing a total of 236 participants, in the review. Two trials had parallel-group design, the third had a two-period cross-over design, and the fourth had a three-period cross-over design. We judged all four studies to be at an unclear risk of bias overall. Bias arose from the incomplete reporting of methodological details, the incomplete and selective reporting of outcome data, and from participants having unstable drug regimens during experimental treatment in one trial. Due to significant methodological heterogeneity, clinical heterogeneity and differences in outcome measures, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis of the extracted data. Only one study reported the outcome of 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, whilst three studies reported percentage reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo. One study claimed an average seizure reduction of 35.8% with add-on felbamate whilst another study claimed a more modest reduction of 4.2%. Both studies reported that seizure frequency increased with add-on placebo and that there was a significant difference in seizure reduction between felbamate and placebo (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.018, respectively). The third study reported a 14% reduction in seizure frequency with add-on felbamate but stated that the difference between treatments was not significant. There were conflicting results regarding treatment withdrawal. One study reported a higher treatment withdrawal for placebo-randomised participants, whereas the other three studies reported higher treatment withdrawal rates for felbamate-randomised participants. Notably, the treatment withdrawal rates for felbamate treatment groups across all four studies remained reasonably low (less than 10%), suggesting that felbamate may be well tolerated. Felbamate-randomised participants most commonly withdrew from treatment due to adverse effects. The adverse effects consistently reported by all four studies were headache, dizziness and nausea. All three adverse effects were reported by 23% to 40% of felbamate-treated participants versus 3% to 15% of placebo-treated participants. We assessed the evidence for all outcomes using GRADE and rated the evidence as very low certainty, meaning that we have little confidence in the findings reported. We mainly downgraded evidence for imprecision due to the narrative synthesis conducted and the low number of events. We stress that the true effect of felbamate could likely be significantly different from that reported in this current review update.	We looked at four studies that tested whether a medicine called felbamate was helpful for people with epilepsy who don't respond well to other treatments. These studies involved a total of 236 people. The studies were not perfect, as they didn't always clearly explain how they were done and what they found. They also didn't use the same methods or look for the same results. We weren't able to combine the results from all of these studies together. Some studies suggested that felbamate might reduce seizures by 35.8% or even by a small amount like 4.2%. But others didn't find a clear difference between felbamate and a fake medicine (placebo). Some people stopped taking felbamate because of side effects like headaches, dizziness, and nausea, but overall, not many people stopped taking it. We are not very sure if felbamate actually works, because the studies we looked at were not very reliable. We need better studies to tell us for sure whether felbamate is a good treatment for epilepsy.	This study looked at whether a medicine called felbamate helps people with seizures. They reviewed four studies with a total of 236 people. The studies looked at whether felbamate helps reduce seizures by 50% or more compared to a fake medicine (placebo). The studies found that felbamate can cause side effects like headaches, dizziness, and nausea. However, the evidence for these side effects was not very strong, meaning we can't be completely sure about the results.
186	The following databases were searched up to April 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO. Studies involving hydroflotation, gel and such pharmacological agents as steroids, noxytioline, heparin, promethazine, N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists were evaluated.	We searched a number of databases for studies about different treatments for pain, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO.  We looked at studies that used hydroflotation, gel, and certain medications like steroids, noxytioline, heparin, promethazine, N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists.	We searched several medical databases for studies on hydroflotation, gel, and other medications like steroids, noxytioline, heparin, promethazine, N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan, and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists. We looked at studies published up to April 2014 in these databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and PsycINFO. We also looked at studies that used hydroflotation, gel, and such pharmacological agents as steroids, noxytioline, heparin, promethazine, N,O-carboxymethyl chitosan and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists.
187	The frequency of skin ulceration makes an important contributor to the morbidity burden in people with sickle cell disease. Many treatment options are available to the healthcare professional, although it is uncertain which treatments have been assessed for effectiveness in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.	People with sickle cell disease often have skin sores, which makes it hard for them to live a normal life.  There are many treatments available, but we don't know if they actually work.  This is an update to a previous review of the research on this topic.	Skin ulceration is a common problem for people with sickle cell disease, and it can lead to serious health problems. There are many treatments available, but it's not clear which ones are best for people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previous review.
188	Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and extracted data. We calculated relative risk (RR) and rate ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare prevalence and incidence, respectively, in MDA compared to no-MDA groups. We stratified analyses by malaria transmission and by malaria species. For cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), we adjusted standard errors using the intracluster correlation coefficient. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. For non-randomized controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies, we summarized the data using difference-in-differences (DiD) analyses.	We wanted to see if a medicine called MDA helped prevent malaria. We looked at studies that compared people who took MDA to people who didn't. We wanted to know how common malaria was and how often people got sick with malaria. We looked at the studies very carefully to see if the results were reliable.	Two researchers independently looked at the studies to see if they met our criteria and collected data. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and rate ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) to compare the prevalence and incidence of MDA compared to no-MDA groups. We stratified the analyses based on how malaria spreads and by malaria species. For cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), we adjusted standard errors using intracluster correlation coefficient. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. For non-randomized controlled before-and-after studies, we summarized the data using difference-in-differences (DiD) analyses.
189	Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles and records, assessed risk of bias and extracted outcome data independently. We used a random-effects model to perform meta-analysis and calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.	Two researchers read all the abstracts and full-text articles, assessed the quality of the studies, and extracted the results independently. We used a statistical method called a random-effects model to analyze the results of all studies together. We calculated the risk ratio for studies with yes-or-no outcomes and the mean difference for studies with continuous outcomes. We also reported the 95% confidence interval for each result. Finally, we assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.	Two researchers read all the summaries and full articles and records, assessed how reliable the studies were, and collected data independently. We used a statistical method called a random-effects model to combine the results of all the studies. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for outcomes that were either positive or negative, and mean differences (MDs) for outcomes that were positive or negative. We used 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the effects of the treatments. We also assessed the quality of the evidence using a system called GRADE.
190	We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. The first search was performed in November 2017 and was updated in April 2020. In the update of the search, 39 eligible studies were found that were not included in the analysis (listed as awaiting classification).	To find the best treatment, researchers looked for studies on antiemetic drugs in several medical databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and others. They started their search in November 2017 and updated it in April 2020. They found 39 new studies that fit their criteria but weren't included in their initial analysis.

191	Data on the effectiveness, safety and women's experiences of home versus inpatient induction of labour are limited and of very low-certainty. Given that serious adverse events are likely to be extremely rare, the safety data are more likely to come from very large observational cohort studies rather than relatively small RCTs.	We don't have a lot of reliable information on how safe and effective it is to induce labor at home compared to doing it in a hospital. Since serious complications are very rare, we'd need a very large study to gather enough data to understand the safety of both options.	We don't have a lot of information about how effective, safe, and how women feel about starting labor at home compared to going to the hospital. We also don't have enough information about serious side effects, so we need more information from very large studies.
192	To determine the effectiveness of shared care health service interventions designed to improve the management of chronic disease across the primary/specialty care interface. This is an update of a previously published review. Secondary questions include the following: 1. Which shared care interventions or portions of shared care interventions are most effective? 2. What do the most effective systems have in common?	"We're trying to figure out if a special kind of healthcare service called ""shared care"" can help improve how people manage their chronic illnesses. This is an update of an older study on the same topic. We're also looking into what parts of shared care work best, and what common elements make these successful programs so effective."	This study aims to understand the effectiveness of shared care healthcare interventions designed to improve the management of chronic disease across the primary/specialty care interface. The goal is to determine the effectiveness of shared care interventions designed to improve the management of chronic disease across the primary/specialty care interface. This is an updated version of a previous review. Secondary questions include: 1. Which shared care interventions or parts of shared care interventions are most effective? 2. What do the most effective systems have in common?
193	Digital monitoring plus tailored support via an online platform probably improves adherence to inhaled therapies and reduces treatment burden (but without a corresponding change in QoL) in the medium term (low- and moderate-certainty evidence). In a shorter time frame, technological enhancement of inhaling antibiotics may improve adherence to treatment (low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no effect on lung function with either intervention, and online monitoring probably makes no difference to pulmonary exacerbations. Future research should assess the effect of digital technology on adherence in both children and adults. Consideration of adherence to the total treatment regimen is also important, as an improvement in adherence to inhaled therapies could come at the cost of adherence to other parts of the treatment regimen.	This review found that using technology like online platforms and special nebulizers may help people with cystic fibrosis (CF) take their medicine more often and makes it easier for them. This might lead to them feeling better in the long run, but doesn't seem to have a big effect on their quality of life.  More studies are needed to see if these technologies help both children and adults with CF take their medicine more often.	Doctors are trying to figure out if using digital monitoring and personalized support online can help people stick to their inhaled antibiotics in the long run. They think that using digital monitoring and personalized support online might help people stick to their inhaled medications and reduce the cost of treatment, but it doesn't seem to improve quality of life in the long run. In the short term, using technology to improve inhaling antibiotics might also help people stick to their inhaled medications. However, there may not be much effect on lung function, and online monitoring probably doesn't make a difference in lung flare-ups. Future research should look at how digital technology affects adherence to inhaled medications in both children and adults. It's also important to consider the cost of adherence to other parts of the treatment plan, as an improvement in adherence might come at the cost of adherence to other parts of the treatment plan.
194	We included 34 studies that examined a range of different antiemetics, used different doses and comparators, and reported a variety of outcomes. The quality and quantity of included studies limited the exploration of heterogeneity to narrative approaches only. The majority of quantitative data related to the complete control of acute vomiting (27 studies). Adverse events were reported in 29 studies and nausea outcomes in 16 studies. Two studies assessed the addition of dexamethasone to 5-HT3 antagonists for complete control of vomiting (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35 to 3.04). Three studies compared granisetron 20 mcg/kg with 40 mcg/kg for complete control of vomiting (pooled RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.07). Three studies compared granisetron with ondansetron for complete control of acute nausea (pooled RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.17; 2 studies), acute vomiting (pooled RR 2.26; 95% CI 2.04 to 2.51; 3 studies), delayed nausea (pooled RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.38; 2 studies), and delayed vomiting (pooled RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.29; 2 studies). No other pooled analyses were possible. Narrative synthesis suggests that 5-HT3 antagonists are more effective than older antiemetic agents, even when these agents are combined with a steroid. Cannabinoids are probably effective but produce frequent side effects.	We examined 34 studies that looked at different anti-nausea medications, dosages, and comparisons.  The quality and quantity of studies didn't allow us to do detailed analysis of differences, so we mostly used descriptive summaries. Most data focused on completely stopping acute vomiting (27 studies). Side effects were reported in 29 studies and nausea outcomes in 16.  Two studies looked at adding dexamethasone to 5-HT3 antagonists for stopping vomiting.  Combining these, we found that adding dexamethasone doubled the chance of success (risk ratio 2.03).  Three studies compared different doses of granisetron.  The results showed no difference in stopping vomiting.  Three studies compared granisetron to ondansetron.  Granisetron was slightly better at stopping vomiting but the difference wasn't huge.  We couldn't combine data for other medications.  Overall, it seems that 5-HT3 antagonists are better than older anti-nausea drugs, even when those older drugs are used with steroids.  Cannabis products seem to work but often have side effects.	This study looked at 34 different studies that tested different antiemetics, like dexamethasone, 5-HT3 antagonists, and ondansetron. The study found that 5-HT3 antagonists are more effective than older antiemetics, even when combined with a steroid. Cannabinoids are probably effective but have some side effects.
195	Although some interventions for late radiation proctopathy look promising (including rectal sucralfate, metronidazole added to an anti-inflammatory regimen, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy), single small studies provide limited evidence. Furthermore, outcomes important to people with cancer, including quality of life (QoL) and long-term effects, were not well recorded. The episodic and variable nature of late radiation proctopathy requires large multi-centre placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) to establish whether treatments are effective. Future studies should address the possibility of associated injury to other gastro-intestinal, urinary, or sexual organs, known as pelvic radiation disease. The interventions, as well as the outcome parameters, should be broader and include those important to people with cancer, such as QoL evaluations.	There are a few promising treatments for a condition called late radiation proctopathy, but the evidence is limited because the studies are small.  These treatments include rectal sucralfate, metronidazole added to other medicines, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.  The studies also don't provide enough information about how these treatments affect quality of life or long-term health.  We need large-scale, multi-center studies with a control group to confirm whether these treatments are truly effective.  Future studies should also look at how these treatments affect other organs in the pelvis.  We need to improve the way we measure the effectiveness of treatments by including quality of life measures and other factors important to people with cancer.	Even though some treatments for late radiation proctopathy look promising (like rectal sucralfate, metronidazole added to an anti-inflammatory regimen, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy), only a few small studies have provided limited evidence.

196	The Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group searched their specialised Trials Register (latest 30 March 2017), which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We searched the references of all included studies. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register.	This study searched many different medical databases for information about people with schizophrenia.  They used a special computer program to find all the studies on schizophrenia that were published up to March 30, 2017.  They also looked through the list of references in the studies they found to see if there were any other studies they missed.  They included all the studies they found, regardless of the language they were written in, when they were published, or the type of document they were.	The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group searched their specialized Trials Register, which is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PsycINFO, and clinical trial registries. We also looked at the references of all the studies we included. We didn't limit our search by language, date, document type, or publication status.
197	We included two trials in this review. One trial from Finland compared laser-assisted endonasal DCR with external DCR, and one trial from India compared mechanical endonasal DCR (using punch forceps) with external DCR. The trials were poorly reported and it was difficult to judge the extent to which bias had been avoided. Anatomic success was defined as the demonstration of a patent lacrimal passage on syringing, or endoscopic visualisation of fluorescein dye at the nasal opening of the anastomoses after a period of at least six months following surgery. Subjective success was defined as the resolution of symptoms of watering following surgery after a period of at least six months. Both included trials used anatomic patency demonstrated by irrigation as a measure of anatomic success. Different effects were seen in these two trials (I2 = 76%). People receiving laser-assisted endonasal DCR were less likely to have a successful operation compared with external DCR (63% versus 91%; risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.52 to 0.92; 64 participants). There was little or no difference in success comparing mechanical endonasal DCR and external DCR (90% in both groups; RR 1.00, CI 0.81 to 1.23; 40 participants). We judged this evidence on success to be very low-certainty, downgrading for risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. The trial from Finland also assessed subjective improvement in symptoms following surgery. Resolution of symptoms of watering in outdoor conditions was reported by 84% of the participants in the external DCR group and 59% of those in the laser-assisted endonasal DCR group (RR 0.70, CI 0.51 to 0.97; 64 participants, low-certainty evidence). There were no cases of intraoperative bleeding in any participant in the trial that compared laser-assisted endonasal DCR to external DCR. This was in contrast to the trial comparing mechanical endonasal DCR to external DCR in which 45% of participants in both groups experienced intraoperative bleeding (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.98; 40 participants). We judged this evidence on intraoperative bleeding to be very low-certainty, downgrading for risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. There were only two cases of postoperative bleeding, both in the external DCR group (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.10; participants = 104; studies = 2). There were only two cases of wound infection/gaping, again both in the external DCR group (RR 0.20, CI 0.01 to 3.92; participants = 40; studies = 1). We judged this evidence on complications to be very low-certainty, downgrading one level for risk of bias and two levels for imprecision due to the very low number of cases.	This review looked at two studies that compared different ways to treat a blocked tear duct. One study from Finland compared laser surgery to a more traditional surgery. The other study from India compared a different type of surgery using special tools to the traditional surgery.  Unfortunately, the studies weren't very well done, making it hard to tell if there was any bias in the results. They looked at two things: whether the tear duct was open after surgery and whether people's watery eyes got better.  They found that the laser surgery might be less successful than the traditional surgery, but the other type of surgery seemed to be about the same.  Overall, the evidence for success was very weak because the studies were not very good, had few participants, and showed different results. The study from Finland also found that fewer people who had the laser surgery had their watery eyes get better.  There wasn't much difference in bleeding during surgery, but there were very few cases of other complications like bleeding or infection after surgery.  Again, the evidence for these complications was very weak because there were so few cases.	This review looked at two studies that compared laser-assisted endonasal DCR (a type of surgery that uses a special tool called a punch forceps) to external DCR. One study from Finland compared laser-assisted endonasal DCR to external DCR, and another study from India compared mechanical endonasal DCR (using punch forceps) to external DCR. The studies were poorly reported and it was difficult to judge how well they were done. The results showed that laser-assisted endonasal DCR was less likely to have a successful operation compared to external DCR. However, there was little or no difference in success between mechanical endonasal DCR and external DCR. The study from Finland also looked at subjective improvement in symptoms after surgery. The study found that laser-assisted endonasal DCR was less likely to have a successful operation compared to external DCR. However, there was no evidence that laser-assisted endonasal DCR caused bleeding during surgery. Overall, the evidence suggests that laser-assisted endonasal DCR is a safe and effective way to perform surgery.
198	Analyses included 18 trials including 9017 participants, of whom 6924 were NHW and 2093 NHB participants. Data were available for the following biomarkers: nine SNPs (rs1051730 (CHRNA3); rs16969968, rs588765, and rs2036527 (CHRNA5); rs3733829 and rs7937 (in EGLN2, near CYP2A6); rs1329650 and rs1028936 (LOC100188947); and rs215605 (PDE1C)), two variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs; DRD4 and SLC6A4), and the NMR. Included data produced a total of 40 active versus placebo comparisons, 16 active versus active comparisons, and 64 between-genotype comparisons within treatment arms. For those meta-analyses showing statistically significant heterogeneity between genotype groups, we found the quality of evidence (GRADE) to be generally moderate. We downgraded quality most often because of imprecision or risk of bias due to potential selection bias in genotyping trial participants. Comparisons of relative treatment effects by genotype For six-month abstinence, we found statistically significant heterogeneity between genotypes (rs16969968) for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo at six months for NHB participants (P = 0.03; n = 2 trials), but not for other biomarkers or treatment comparisons. Six-month abstinence was increased in the active NRT group as compared to placebo among participants with a GG genotype (risk ratio (RR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 2.03), but not in the combined group of participants with a GA or AA genotype (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.26; ratio of risk ratios (RRR) GG vs GA or AA of 3.51, 95% CI 1.19 to 10.3). Comparisons of treatment effects between genotype groups within pharmacotherapy randomisation arms For those receiving active NRT, treatment was more effective in achieving six-month abstinence among individuals with a slow NMR than among those with a normal NMR among NHW and NHB combined participants (normal NMR vs slow NMR: RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.78; n = 2 trials). We found no such differences in treatment effects between genotypes at six months for any of the other biomarkers among individuals who received pharmacotherapy or placebo.	This study looked at 18 different trials with a total of 9017 people who were trying to quit smoking. The researchers wanted to see if certain genes or genetic variations might influence how well different smoking cessation medications worked. They looked at a variety of genetic factors, including specific gene variations (SNPs), repeated DNA sequences (VNTRs), and how quickly people break down certain medications (NMR). They found some interesting results: For people of African descent, one specific gene variation (rs16969968) seemed to influence how well nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) worked. People with one version of this gene variation (GG genotype) seemed to benefit more from NRT compared to those with other versions. They also found that, in general, people who metabolized medications more slowly (slow NMR) tended to benefit more from NRT than those who metabolized medications quickly. However, the researchers emphasized that these findings are preliminary, and more research is needed to confirm them.	This study looked at the effects of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) on people who were taking nicotine replacement therapy (NHW) and those who were taking nicotine replacement therapy (NHHB). They found that NRT was more effective in helping people stop smoking for six months compared to a placebo (a fake treatment). However, the study also found that NRT was more effective in people with slower NMRs than people with slower NMRs.
199	We searched in the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Library (to May 2017), MEDLINE (OvidSP; to May 2017), Embase (OvidSP; to May 2017), and SIGLE grey literature (up to May 2017) and clinical trial registries; we handsearched abstracts from conferences up to May 2017. We screened non-systematic reviews, systematic reviews and guidelines to identify any additional trials. We contacted trialists to obtain missing information.	We searched many different medical databases and trial registries to find studies about this topic. We also looked at summaries of research and guidelines to find more studies.

200	Two authors independently reviewed all identified trials and data, and assessed trial quality. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. For cross-over trials we stipulated a one-week washout period. We planned to use results from a paired analysis in the review, but this was only possible in one trial. For other cross-over trials, we chose to treat the trials as if they were parallel.	Two experts looked at all the studies and their data, and they checked how good the studies were. They used a system called GRADE to see how certain we could be about the results. For studies that had people switch between treatments, we said they had to have a one-week break between the treatments. We planned to combine the results from these switch-over studies, but we could only do this for one study. For the other studies, we treated them as if they were regular studies.	Two researchers independently reviewed all the studies and data, and assessed the quality of the studies. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. For cross-over trials, we stipulated a one-week washout period. We planned to use results from a paired analysis in the review, but this was only possible in one trial. For other cross-over trials, we chose to treat the trials as if they were parallel.
201	We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome measures were incidence rate of Frey's syndrome assessed clinically (Minor's starch-iodine test) and other complications (postoperative infection, subjective painful or restricted cervical movement, scar spread, rejection of the graft, complications related to the donor site such as accessory nerve injury and haematoma). Our secondary outcome measures were incidence rate of Frey's syndrome assessed by participants (by questionnaire) and sweating area assessed by Minor's starch-iodine test. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.	We followed the standard scientific methods used by Cochrane.  We were most interested in how often Frey's syndrome happened, which we checked using a special test.  We also looked at other complications like infections, neck pain, scars, and problems with the graft or the donor.  We also looked at how often Frey's syndrome was reported by the patients themselves, and how big the area of sweating was.  We used a system called GRADE to figure out how reliable the evidence was for each outcome.	We used the standard methods used by Cochrane to conduct this study. We were mainly interested in how often people had Frey's syndrome, which is a condition that affects the cervix. We also looked at other complications like infection, pain, scarring, rejection of the graft, and complications related to the donor site. We also looked at how often people had Frey's syndrome and how much sweat they sweated. We used a system called GRADE to assess how certain we were about the evidence for each outcome.
202	Acoustic stimulation of the fetus has been suggested to improve the efficiency of antepartum fetal heart rate testing. To assess the advantages and disadvantages of the use of fetal vibroacoustic stimulation in conjunction with tests of fetal wellbeing. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2013). All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials assessing the merits of the use of fetal vibroacoustic stimulation in conjunction with tests of fetal wellbeing. All review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Authors of published and unpublished trials were contacted for further information. Altogether 12 trials with a total of 6822 participants were included. Fetal vibroacoustic stimulation reduced the incidence of non-reactive antenatal cardiotocography test (nine trials; average risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.81). Vibroacoustic stimulation compared with mock stimulation evoked significantly more fetal movements when used in conjunction with fetal heart rate testing (one trial, RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.29). Vibroacoustic stimulation offers benefits by decreasing the incidence of non-reactive cardiotocography and reducing the testing time. Further randomised trials should be encouraged to determine not only the optimum intensity, frequency, duration and position of the vibroacoustic stimulation, but also to evaluate the efficacy, predictive reliability, safety and perinatal outcome of these stimuli with cardiotocography and other tests of fetal wellbeing.	Doctors are trying to find ways to make tests on a baby's heart during pregnancy more effective. One method is to use sound vibrations to wake up the baby, which may make the heart beat more clearly and show if the baby is healthy. This research looked at 12 studies with over 6800 pregnant women. The results showed that using sound vibrations reduced the number of tests that didn't show a clear heartbeat.  The vibration also caused more movements in the baby during the tests. Overall, sound vibrations seem to help with these tests, but more research is needed to figure out the best way to use them and how safe they are for the baby.	This study looked at whether using a special type of sound therapy called vibroacoustic stimulation in the womb (fetus vibroacoustic stimulation) could help doctors test the baby's heart rate before giving birth. The study found that vibroacoustic stimulation was helpful in reducing the number of tests that don't show the baby's heart rate. It also showed that vibroacoustic stimulation helped the baby move more when used with heart rate tests. The study suggests that more research is needed to see if vibroacoustic stimulation is a good way to test the baby's heart rate before giving birth.
203	We searched MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to 2021), Embase (Ovid) (1974 to 2021), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1982 to 2021), and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL). Clinical trial registries and relevant conference proceedings were also reviewed. Records were included as of 7 March 2021. We did not impose any language restrictions.	We searched four major medical databases (MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the Cochrane Library) for studies on this topic. We also looked through clinical trial registries and conference proceedings.  We included studies published up to March 7, 2021, and we didn't limit our search to any particular language.	We searched several medical databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and the Cochrane Library, for studies published between 1946 and 2021. We also looked at clinical trial registries and conference proceedings. We included all the studies we found as of March 7, 2021. We didn't limit our search by language.
204	This review included only one trial (21 participants), which compared fish oil-derived (n-3) fatty acid-based lipid emulsion (50 mL per infusion (1.05 g eicosapentaenoic and 10.5 g docosahexaenoic acid)) (10 participants) to soya oil-derived (n-6) fatty acid-based lipid emulsion (50 mL per infusion (1.05 g eicosapentaenoic and 10.5 g docosahexaenoic acid)) (11 participants) administered intravenously twice daily for 10 days, with a total follow-up of 40 days. The study was conducted in a single centre in Germany in 18 men and three women, aged between 21 and 65 years, who were in hospital with acute guttate psoriasis and had mean total body surface involvement of 25.7% +- 20.4% (range 10 to 90). The study was funded by a company that produces the oil emulsions. We found no other evidence regarding non-antistreptococcal interventions used in clinical practice for guttate psoriasis, such as topical treatments (corticosteroids, vitamin D3 analogues), systemic drugs, biological therapy, and phototherapy. The primary outcomes of the review were not measured, and only one of our secondary outcomes was measured: improvement in participant satisfaction measures and quality of life assessment measures. However, the study authors did report that there was rare skin irritation at the site of peripheral intravenous route, but the number of affected participants was not provided. Improvement between baseline and day 10, using a non-validated score assessed by participants themselves daily based on five items (appearance of lesions, impairment of daily life, pruritus, burning, and pain), was greater in the group that received the fish oil-derived (n-3) fatty acid-based lipid emulsion (75%) than in the group receiving the soya oil-derived (n-6) fatty acid-based lipid emulsion (18%) (one trial, 21 participants). However, these results are uncertain as they are based on very low-quality evidence.	This study looked at whether giving patients with guttate psoriasis a special type of fish oil (n-3 fatty acids) intravenously twice a day for 10 days could help their condition. They compared this to giving patients a different type of oil (soy oil, n-6 fatty acids) for the same time period. The study was small, with only 21 participants, and it was done in Germany. They found that the fish oil group had more improvement in their symptoms compared to the soy oil group. However, the results are uncertain because the study was small and had some weaknesses. We also found no evidence on other treatments commonly used for guttate psoriasis, such as creams, pills, or light therapy.	This study looked at different ways to treat psoriasis, a skin condition that affects the skin. They compared two different types of emulsions: fish oil and soya oil. The study was done in Germany and involved 21 people with psoriasis. The emulsions were given through a vein twice a day for 10 days. The study found that the emulsions were better than the soya oil emulsions. However, the results are uncertain because the evidence is not very strong.
205	We have found no new studies since the last version of this review was published in 2017. This review does not provide sufficient evidence to support topiramate for the treatment of people with JME. Based on the current limited available data, topiramate seems to be better tolerated than valproate, but has no clear benefits over valproate in terms of efficacy. Well-designed, double-blind RCTs with large samples are required to test the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate in people with JME.	We haven't found any new studies since the last time we looked at this topic in 2017. We don't have enough evidence to say that topiramate is a good medicine for people with JME.  Based on what little we know, topiramate seems to cause fewer side effects than valproate, but it doesn't seem to be any better at treating seizures. We need more studies, done in a way that makes sure the researchers and patients don't know who is getting which medicine, with lots of people involved, to figure out if topiramate is a good treatment for JME.	We haven't found any new studies since our last review in 2017. This review doesn't provide enough evidence to say whether topiramate is a good treatment for people with JME. Topiramate seems to be better tolerated than valproate, but it doesn't seem to have any clear benefits over valproate in terms of how well it works. We need more well-designed, double-blind studies with large groups of people to test the effectiveness and tolerability of topiramate in people with JME.
206	The short-term benefits for babies included less respiratory distress and fewer serious health problems in the first few weeks after birth with repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women still at risk of preterm birth seven days or more after an initial course. The current available evidence reassuringly shows no significant harm for the women or child in early and mid-childhood, although no benefit. Further research is needed on the long-term benefits and risks for the baby into adulthood.	Giving pregnant women who are at risk of having a premature baby a special medicine called corticosteroids can help their babies have fewer breathing problems and other health issues in the first few weeks after birth.  Studies so far show that this medicine is safe for both the mother and child in the early years. However, we don't know if there are any long-term benefits or risks for the baby when they grow up. More research is needed to understand this better.	This study looked at the long-term effects of prenatal corticosteroids on babies. They found that repeated doses of prenatal corticosteroids might help babies breathe better and have fewer serious health problems in the first few weeks after birth. The study also found that repeated doses of prenatal corticosteroids were helpful for women who were at risk of having a premature birth seven days or more after taking the first dose. The current evidence shows that prenatal corticosteroids did not cause any harm to the women or children in early and mid-childhood, but no benefit. More research is needed to understand the long-term benefits and risks for the baby into adulthood.
207	Anti-leukotriene (AL) agents are being considered as'add-on' therapy to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), in chronic asthma. To examine the safety and efficacy of daily AL plus ICS compared to ICS alone, and determine the corticosteroid-sparing effect of AL when added to ICS in chronic asthma. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (until August 2003), reference lists of review articles and trials, contacted international headquarters of AL manufacturers and looked at American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society meeting abstracts (1998 to 2003). Randomised placebo-controlled trials of asthmatics aged two years and older with at least one month intervention. Two reviewers assessed quality and extracted data independently. Trials were grouped by asthma control at baseline (symptomatic or well-controlled) and dose of ICS in the control group (same or double). Of 587citations, 27 (25 adult and 2 paediatric) trials met inclusion criteria. Sixteen trials were published in full-text and 16 trials reported data in a way that allowed meta-analysis. In symptomatic patients, addition of licensed doses of anti-leukotrienes to ICS resulted in a non-significant reduction in the risk of exacerbations requiring systemic steroids: Relative Risk (RR) 0.64; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.07). A modest improvement group difference in PEF was seen (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 7.7 L/min; 95% CI 3.6 to 11.8 L/min) together with decrease in use of rescue short-acting beta2-agonist use (WMD 1 puff/week; 95%CI 0.5 to 2). With only 3 trials comparing the use of licensed doses of anti-leukotrienes with increasing the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids, no firm conclusion can be drawn about the equivalence of both treatment options. In ICS-sparing studies of patients who were well controlled at baseline, addition of anti-leukotrienes produced no overall difference in dose of inhaled glucocorticoids (WMD -21 mcg/d, 95%CI -65, 23 mcg/d), but it was associated with fewer withdrawals due to poor asthma control (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.95). The addition of licensed doses of anti-leukotrienes to add-on therapy to inhaled glucocorticoids brings modest improvement in lung function. Although addition of anti-leukotrienes to inhaled glucocorticoids appears comparable to increasing the dose of inhaled steroids, the power of the review is insufficient to confirm the equivalence of both treatment options. Addition of anti-leukotrienes is associated with superior asthma control after glucocorticoid tapering; although the glucocorticoid-sparing effect cannot be quantified at present, it appears modest.	Doctors are looking into whether adding anti-leukotriene (AL) drugs to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) can help people with chronic asthma. They want to see if this combination is safe and effective compared to using ICS alone. They also want to see if AL can help reduce the amount of corticosteroids needed. They looked at a lot of studies on people with asthma, focusing on those who were at least two years old and had been taking their asthma medicine for at least a month. They found that adding AL to ICS in people with uncontrolled asthma resulted in a small improvement in lung function and a slight reduction in the need for rescue inhalers. However, they didn't have enough evidence to say whether AL is as effective as increasing the dose of ICS. When AL was added to ICS in people whose asthma was well-controlled, it didn't lead to a significant reduction in the amount of ICS needed, but it did help people stay on their asthma treatment longer. Overall, while adding AL to ICS shows some benefits, the amount of improvement is modest. More research is needed to confirm these findings.	This study looked at whether adding anti-leukotriene (AL) to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is safe and effective for people with chronic asthma. Anti-leukotriene is a type of medicine that can be added to inhaled corticosteroids. The researchers wanted to see if adding AL to ICS was better than just adding ICS for people with asthma. They found that adding AL to ICS didn't seem to make a big difference in how often people needed to take steroids. However, adding AL to ICS didn't seem to make a big difference in how often people needed to take steroids. The researchers also found that adding AL to ICS didn't seem to make a big difference in how much inhaled corticosteroids people needed. They also found that adding AL to ICS didn't seem to make a big difference in how much inhaled corticosteroids people needed. More research is needed to see if adding AL to ICS is a safe and effective way to treat asthma.
208	Randomised and quasi-randomised studies of rTMS, CES, tDCS, RINCE and tRNS if they employed a sham stimulation control group, recruited patients over the age of 18 years with pain of three months' duration or more, and measured pain as an outcome. Outcomes of interest were pain intensity measured using visual analogue scales or numerical rating scales, disability, quality of life and adverse events.	We included studies that used these brain stimulation techniques on people over 18 years old with chronic pain for at least three months. These studies had to compare the brain stimulation to a sham (fake) stimulation to see if the real stimulation was making a difference. We were looking at how the stimulation affected pain levels, disability, quality of life, and any side effects.	This study looked at different types of pain relief devices called rTMS, CES, tDCS, RINCE, and tRNS. The researchers wanted to see if these devices could be used to control pain in people over 18 years old who had pain that lasted three months or more. They also wanted to see if these devices could measure things like pain intensity, disability, quality of life, and side effects.
209	We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group specialized register in June 2015. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL, using variant terms and spellings ('waterpipe' or'narghile' or'arghile' or'shisha' or'goza' or'narkeela' or'hookah' or'hubble bubble'). We searched for trials, published or unpublished, in any language, and especially in regions where waterpipe use is widespread.	"We searched for relevant studies on waterpipe smoking in June 2015.

210	We included 21 studies, involving a total of 762 participants. Participants were in the acute, subacute, or chronic stages of stroke, and had a mean age ranging from 50 to 78 years. All participants presented at least some gait deficit. All studies compared MI training versus other therapies. Most of the included studies used MI associated with physical practice in the experimental groups. The treatment time for the experimental groups ranged from two to eight weeks. There was a high risk of bias for at least one assessed domain in 20 of the 21 included studies. Regarding our critical outcome, there was very low-certainty evidence that MI was more beneficial for improving gait (walking speed) compared to other therapies at the end of the treatment (pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.44; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.81; P = 0.02; six studies; 191 participants; I2 = 38%). We did not include the outcome of dependence on personal assistance in the meta-analysis, because only one study provided information regarding the number of participants that became dependent or independent after interventions. For our important outcomes, there was very low-certainty evidence that MI was no more beneficial than other interventions for improving motor function (pooled mean difference (MD) 2.24, 95% CI -1.20 to 5.69; P = 0.20; three studies; 130 participants; I2 = 87%) and functional mobility at the end of the treatment (pooled SMD 0.55, 95% CI -0.45 to 1.56; P = 0.09; four studies; 116 participants; I2 = 64.2%). No adverse events were observed in those studies that reported this outcome (seven studies). We were unable to pool data regarding walking endurance and all other outcomes at follow-up.	"We looked at 21 studies that included 762 people who had had a stroke. These people were in different stages of recovery, from the very beginning to months after their stroke. They were all having trouble walking.  All the studies compared a technique called ""Motor Imagery"" (MI) training with other types of therapy.  Most of the studies using MI also had the patients practice the movements.  The MI training lasted between two and eight weeks.  We found that MI might be helpful for improving walking speed, but we weren't very sure because the evidence was weak.  We couldn't say for sure if MI was better than other therapies for improving movement or being able to move around easily.   We also didnâ€™t have enough information to see if MI caused any problems."	This study looked at 21 different studies involving 762 people who had had a stroke. Most of the people in the studies had trouble walking. The studies compared MI to other treatments. Most of the studies used MI along with physical activity. The treatments lasted from two to eight weeks. The study found that MI didn't seem to be better than other treatments at improving walking speed or mobility. It also didn't seem to cause any side effects.
211	We included in the review a total of 70 eligible studies, of which a substantial proportion were universal school-based studies (n = 28; 40%). Most studies were conducted in the USA (n = 55; 79%). On average, studies aimed to prevent four of the primary behaviours. Behaviours that were most frequently addressed included alcohol use (n = 55), drug use (n = 53), and/or antisocial behaviour (n = 53), followed by tobacco use (n = 42). No studies aimed to prevent self-harm or gambling alongside other behaviours. Evidence suggests that for multiple risk behaviours, universal school-based interventions were beneficial in relation to tobacco use (odds ratio (OR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.97; n = 9 studies; 15,354 participants) and alcohol use (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.92; n = 8 studies; 8751 participants; both moderate-quality evidence) compared to a comparator, and that such interventions may be effective in preventing illicit drug use (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.00; n = 5 studies; 11,058 participants; low-quality evidence) and engagement in any antisocial behaviour (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98; n = 13 studies; 20,756 participants; very low-quality evidence) at up to 12 months' follow-up, although there was evidence of moderate to substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 49% to 69%). Moderate-quality evidence also showed that multiple risk behaviour universal school-based interventions improved the odds of physical activity (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.50; I2 = 0%; n = 4 studies; 6441 participants). We considered observed effects to be of public health importance when applied at the population level. Evidence was less certain for the effects of such multiple risk behaviour interventions for cannabis use (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.01; P = 0.06; n = 5 studies; 4140 participants; I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), sexual risk behaviours (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.12; P = 0.22; n = 6 studies; 12,633 participants; I2 = 77%; low-quality evidence), and unhealthy diet (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.06; P = 0.13; n = 3 studies; 6441 participants; I2 = 49%; moderate-quality evidence). It is important to note that some evidence supported the positive effects of universal school-level interventions on three or more risk behaviours. For most outcomes of individual- and family-level targeted and universal interventions, moderate- or low-quality evidence suggests little or no effect, although caution is warranted in interpretation because few of these studies were available for comparison (n <= 4 studies for each outcome). Seven studies reported adverse effects, which involved evidence suggestive of increased involvement in a risk behaviour among participants receiving the intervention compared to participants given control interventions. We judged the quality of evidence to be moderate or low for most outcomes, primarily owing to concerns around selection, performance, and detection bias and heterogeneity between studies.	This study reviewed 70 research papers about programs designed to prevent risky behaviors in kids. Most of these programs were for all kids in school (not just kids at risk).  The programs were mostly in the USA.  The programs usually aimed to stop four risky behaviors: drinking alcohol, using drugs, acting out in a harmful way, and smoking cigarettes.  None of the programs focused on preventing self-harm or gambling along with other behaviors.  Overall, these programs showed some success in decreasing smoking and drinking, but the results were less clear for preventing drug use, bad behavior, or cannabis use.   The study found that the programs could also help kids become more physically active.  Itâ€™s important to note that some programs were successful in preventing three or more risky behaviors.	This study looked at the effects of universal school-based interventions on multiple risk behaviors, including alcohol, drug use, and antisocial behavior. The study found that universal school-based interventions were helpful in preventing tobacco use, alcohol use, and alcohol use. They also showed that universal school-based interventions might be effective in preventing illicit drug use and antisocial behavior. However, the evidence was not strong enough to say for sure about the effects of universal school-based interventions on cannabis use, sexual risk behaviors, or self-harm. The study also found that universal school-based interventions may be helpful in preventing illicit drug use and antisocial behavior. However, the evidence was not strong enough to say for sure about the effects of universal school-based interventions on cannabis use, sexual risk behaviours, or self-harm.
212	Twenty-nine trials involving 24,300 women are included in this review. Overall, 11 trials were judged to be of low risk of bias, eight were high risk of bias and for 10 trials it was unclear. No clear differences were seen between women supplemented with vitamin C alone or in combination with other supplements compared with placebo or no control for the risk of stillbirth (risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.89 to 1.49; 20,038 participants; 11 studies; I2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence), neonatal death (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.08; 19,575 participants; 11 studies; I2 = 0%), perinatal death (average RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.49; 17,105 participants; seven studies; I2 = 35%), birthweight (mean difference (MD) 26.88 g, 95% CI -18.81 to 72.58; 17,326 participants; 13 studies; I2 = 69%), intrauterine growth restriction (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.06; 20,361 participants; 12 studies; I2 = 15%; high quality evidence), preterm birth (average RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.10; 22,250 participants; 16 studies; I2 = 49%; high quality evidence), preterm PROM (prelabour rupture of membranes) (average RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.36; 16,825 participants; 10 studies; I2 = 70%; low quality evidence), term PROM (average RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.56; 2674 participants; three studies; I2 = 87%), and clinical pre-eclampsia (average RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05; 21,956 participants; 16 studies; I2 = 41%; high quality evidence). Women supplemented with vitamin C alone or in combination with other supplements compared with placebo or no control were at decreased risk of having a placental abruption (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.92; 15,755 participants; eight studies; I2 = 0%; high quality evidence) and had a small increase in gestational age at birth (MD 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.61; 14,062 participants; nine studies; I2 = 65%), however they were also more likely to self-report abdominal pain (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.37; 1877 participants; one study). In the subgroup analyses based on the type of supplement, vitamin C supplementation alone was associated with a reduced risk of preterm PROM (average RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.91; 1282 participants; five studies; I2 = 0%) and term PROM (average RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.94; 170 participants; one study). Conversely, the risk of term PROM was increased when supplementation included vitamin C and vitamin E (average RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.23; 3060 participants; two studies; I2 = 0%). There were no differences in the effects of vitamin C on other outcomes in the subgroup analyses examining the type of supplement. There were no differing patterns in other subgroups of women based on underlying risk of pregnancy complications, timing of commencement of supplementation or dietary intake of vitamin C prior to trial entry. The GRADE quality of the evidence was high for intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, and placental abruption, moderate for stillbirth and clinical pre-eclampsia, low for preterm PROM.	This study looked at 29 different research trials involving a total of 24,300 pregnant women. The researchers were trying to see if taking vitamin C during pregnancy had any effect on the health of the mother and baby. Some of the trials involved giving vitamin C alone, while others gave vitamin C along with other supplements. The results showed that taking vitamin C didn't seem to have much effect on things like the risk of stillbirth, premature birth, or low birth weight. However, vitamin C did seem to reduce the risk of a condition called placental abruption, where the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus too early. The study also found that women who took vitamin C had a slightly longer pregnancy and were more likely to report abdominal pain. When looking at the different types of supplements used, vitamin C alone seemed to help reduce the risk of premature rupture of the membranes (PROM), while vitamin C combined with vitamin E seemed to increase the risk of term PROM. Overall, the study suggests that taking vitamin C during pregnancy may be safe, and it might have some benefits for the mother and baby. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings.	This review looked at 29 studies involving 24,300 women who took vitamin C. The studies found that taking vitamin C alone or in combination with other supplements didn't seem to make a big difference in the risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, perinatal death, birth weight, preterm birth, premature birth, or pre-eclampsia. However, women who took vitamin C were less likely to have a placental abruption and had a small increase in gestational age at birth.
213	We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of psychosocial interventions for prevention and treatment of depression among adults treated with long-term dialysis. We assessed effects of interventions on changes in mental state (depression, anxiety, cognition), suicide, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), withdrawal from dialysis treatment, withdrawal from intervention, death (any cause), hospitalisation and adverse events.	We included studies that involved randomly assigning people to different groups (randomised controlled trials or RCTs) and studies that used similar methods but weren't quite as strict (quasi-RCTs). These studies looked at psychosocial interventions for preventing and treating depression in adults on long-term dialysis. We assessed how these interventions affected mental state (depression, anxiety, thinking skills), suicide risk, quality of life, stopping dialysis, stopping the intervention, death, hospital stays, and any side effects.	We looked at studies that tested different ways to help people with long-term dialysis (dialysis treatment) cope with depression. We included studies where people were randomly assigned to receive either a controlled trial (RCT) or a quasi-RCT (quasi-RCT) of psychosocial interventions for preventing and treating depression. We wanted to see if these interventions affected changes in mental state (depression, anxiety, cognition), suicide, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), withdrawal from dialysis treatment, death (any cause), hospitalization, and side effects.
214	Two reviewers extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios and their 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a random-effects model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE.	"We looked at research studies that tested whether blood transfusions help people with sickle cell disease (SCD).  We carefully checked each study to make sure it was reliable. We used a specific way to analyze the data from these studies, called a ""random-effects model."" We also graded the quality of the evidence from each study."	Two different people looked at the data from the studies we included. We calculated the odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for outcomes that were either binary or continuous. For outcomes that were continuous, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We used a random-effects model to analyze the data. We assessed the risk of bias in the studies we included and created summary tables using GRADE.
215	This is an updated version of the original review published in Issue 4, 2004. The use of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) might be seen as a way of increasing the effectiveness of radical radiotherapy at the same time as reducing the risks of metastatic disease. To determine the effectiveness of concurrent chemoradiotherapy as compared to radiotherapy alone with regard to overall survival, tumour control and treatment-related morbidity. To determine the effectiveness of concurrent versus sequential chemoradiotherapy. For this update we ran a new search in October 2009, using a search strategy adapted from the design in the original review. We searched: CENTRAL (accessed through The Cochrane Library, 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (accessed through PubMed), and EMBASE (accessed through Ovid). Randomised trials of patients with stage I-III NSCLC undergoing radical radiotherapy and randomised to receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone, or concurrent versus sequential chemoradiotherapy. Study selection, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias was performed independently by two authors. Pooled hazard ratios and relative risks were calculated according to a random-effects model. Nineteen randomised studies (2728 participants) of concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone were included. Chemoradiotherapy significantly reduced overall risk of death (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.80; I2 0%; 1607 participants) and overall progression-free survival at any site (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.81; I2 45%; 1145 participants). Incidence of acute oesophagitis, neutropenia and anaemia were significantly increased with concurrent chemoradiation. Six trials (1024 patients) of concurrent versus sequential chemoradiation were included. A significant benefit of concurrent treatment was shown in overall survival (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.89; I2 0%; 702 participants). This represented a 10% absolute survival benefit at 2 years. More treatment-related deaths (4% vs 2%) were reported in the concurrent arm without statistical significance (RR 2.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 4.52; I2 0%; 950 participants). There was increased severe oesophagitis with concurrent treatment (RR 4.96, 95%CI 2.17 to 11.37; I2 66%; 947 participants). This update of the review published in 2004 incorporates additional trials and more mature data. It demonstrates the benefit of concurrent chemoradiation over radiotherapy alone or sequential chemoradiotherapy. Patient selection is an important consideration in view of the added toxicity of concurrent treatment. Uncertainty remains as to how far this is purely due to a radiosensitising effect and whether similar benefits could be achieved by using modern radiotherapy techniques and more dose intensive accelerated and/ or hyperfractionated radiotherapy regimens.	This review looks at how combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy (radiotherapy) works for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The goal is to see if this combination is better than radiation therapy alone in extending life, controlling the cancer, and reducing side effects. We also wanted to know if giving the treatments at the same time is better than giving them one after the other. We found that giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy at the same time helped people live longer and had a better chance of controlling the cancer. However, it also caused more side effects, such as mouth sores, low white blood cell count, and anemia. We also found that giving the treatments at the same time was slightly better than giving them one after the other, but it also led to more deaths from the treatment itself.  It is important to carefully consider the benefits and risks of this combined approach before deciding on the best treatment plan for each patient. More research is needed to understand if these benefits could be achieved with newer radiation techniques.	This study looked at whether giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy together in people with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) could help reduce the risk of the cancer spreading to other parts of the body. The researchers wanted to see if giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy together was better than just giving radiation alone. They looked at 19 studies involving 2728 people with NSCLC. They found that chemotherapy and radiation therapy significantly reduced the risk of death and progression-free survival. They also found that chemotherapy and radiation therapy significantly increased the risk of esophagitis, neutropenia, and anemia. The study also found that chemotherapy and radiation therapy were significantly better than radiation alone in terms of overall survival, tumor control, and side effects.
216	We included 33 studies, published from 1999 to 2019, with 3935 participants of whom 1341 (34%) progressed to Alzheimer's disease dementia and 2594 (66%) did not. Of the participants who did not progress to Alzheimer's disease dementia, 2561 (99%) remained stable MCI and 33 (1%) progressed to other types of dementia. The median proportion of women was 53% and the mean age of participants ranged from 63 to 87 years (median 73 years). The mean length of clinical follow-up ranged from 1 to 7.6 years (median 2 years). Most studies were of poor methodological quality due to risk of bias for participant selection or the index test, or both. Most of the included studies reported data on the volume of the total hippocampus (pooled mean sensitivity 0.73 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.80); pooled mean specificity 0.71 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.77); 22 studies, 2209 participants). This evidence was of low certainty due to risk of bias and inconsistency. Seven studies reported data on the atrophy of the medial temporal lobe (mean sensitivity 0.64 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.73); mean specificity 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.76); 1077 participants) and five studies on the volume of the lateral ventricles (mean sensitivity 0.57 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.65); mean specificity 0.64 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.70); 1077 participants). This evidence was of moderate certainty due to risk of bias. Four studies with 529 participants analysed the volume of the total entorhinal cortex and four studies with 424 participants analysed the volume of the whole brain. We did not estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity for the volume of these two regions because available data were sparse and heterogeneous. We could not statistically evaluate the volumes of the lateral temporal lobe, amygdala, medial temporal gyrus, or cortical grey matter assessed in small individual studies. We found no evidence of a difference between studies in the accuracy of the total hippocampal volume with regards to duration of follow-up or age of participants, but the manual MRI technique was superior to automatic techniques in mixed (mostly indirect) comparisons. We did not assess the relative accuracy of the volumes of different brain regions measured by MRI because only indirect comparisons were available, studies were heterogeneous, and the overall accuracy of all regions was moderate.	We looked at 33 studies from 1999 to 2019 that included 3935 people. Of these, 1341 (34%) went on to develop Alzheimer's disease dementia, while 2594 (66%) did not.  Most of the people who did not develop Alzheimer's stayed at the same level of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and only a few developed other types of dementia.  Most of the studies were not very good because they had problems with how they chose people or how they did the tests, or both.  We found that measuring the volume of the hippocampus (a part of the brain) was a reasonably accurate way to predict Alzheimer's, but the evidence was not very strong because of the problems with the studies.  Measuring the size of other brain areas like the medial temporal lobe and lateral ventricles was also somewhat accurate, but the evidence was better.  We couldn't do a good analysis of the size of some other brain areas because there wasn't enough information.  We also found that using manual methods to measure the hippocampus was better than using automatic methods.	This study looked at 33 different studies that included 3935 people with Alzheimer's disease dementia. Most of the people in these studies had Alzheimer's disease, while many had other types of dementia. The study found that the manual MRI technique was better at measuring the size of the hippocampal area than the automatic MRI technique. The study also found that the manual MRI technique was better at measuring the size of the lateral ventricles, lateral ventricles, and cortical grey matter. The study also found that the manual MRI technique was better at measuring the size of the hippocampal area compared to the automatic MRI technique.
217	Neuropathic pain, which is due to nerve disease or damage, represents a significant burden on people and society. It can be particularly unpleasant and achieving adequate symptom control can be difficult. Non-pharmacological methods of treatment are often employed by people with neuropathic pain and may include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). This review supersedes one Cochrane Review'Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for chronic pain' (Nnoaham 2014) and one withdrawn protocol'Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for neuropathic pain in adults' (Claydon 2014). This review replaces the original protocol for neuropathic pain that was withdrawn.	Neuropathic pain is a type of pain caused by nerve damage. It can be very difficult to deal with and can have a big impact on people's lives.  Many people with neuropathic pain try non-drug treatments like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which uses electricity to stimulate nerves. This review looks at the latest research on using TENS for neuropathic pain, updating previous reviews on the topic.	Neuropathic pain, which is caused by nerve disease or damage, is a big problem for people and society. It can be very unpleasant and it can be hard to control symptoms. People with neuropathic pain often use non-medical methods of treatment, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). This review replaces one previous review on transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for chronic pain and one withdrawn protocol on transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for neuropathic pain in adults. This review replaces the original protocol for neuropathic pain that was withdrawn.
218	Only one study met our inclusion criteria. Participants were men and women (mean age 67 years), with postherpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, or chronic postoperative pain. They were experiencing inadequate relief from non-opioid analgesics, and had not previously taken opioids for their neuropathic pain. The study used an enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal design. It was adequately blinded, but we judged it at unclear risk of bias for other criteria. Transdermal fentanyl (one-day fentanyl patch) was titrated over 10 to 29 days to establish the maximum tolerated and effective dose (12.5 to 50 ug/h). Participants who achieved a prespecified good level of pain relief with a stable dose of fentanyl, without excessive use of rescue medication or intolerable adverse events ('responders'), were randomised to continue with fentanyl or switch to placebo for 12 weeks, under double-blind conditions. Our prespecified primary outcomes were not appropriate for this study design, but the measures reported do give an indication of the efficacy of fentanyl in this condition. In the titration phase, 1 in 3 participants withdrew because of adverse events or inadequate pain relief, and almost 90% experienced adverse events. Of 258 participants who underwent open-label titration, 163 were'responders' and entered the randomised withdrawal phase. The number of participants completing the study (and therefore continuing on treatment) without an increase of pain by more than 15/100 was 47/84 (56%) with fentanyl and 28/79 (35%) with placebo. Because only 63% responded sufficiently to enter the randomised withdrawal phase, this implies that only a maximum of 35% of participants entering the study would have had useful pain relief and tolerability with transdermal fentanyl, compared with 22% with placebo. Almost 60% of participants taking fentanyl were'satisfied' and'very satisfied' with their treatment at the end of the study, compared with about 40% with placebo. This outcome approximates to our primary outcome of moderate benefit using the Patient Global Impression of Change scale, but the group was enriched for responders and the method of analysis was not clear. The most common adverse events were constipation, nausea, somnolence, and dizziness. There was no information about other types of neuropathic pain, other routes of administration, or comparisons with other treatments. We downgraded the quality of the evidence to very low because there was only one study, with few participants and events, and there was no information about how data from people who withdrew were analysed.	This study looked at whether a fentanyl patch (a type of pain medicine) could help people with certain types of nerve pain, like postherpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, or chronic postoperative pain. These people had pain that wasn't getting better with other pain medicines. The study started by giving people increasing doses of the fentanyl patch over a few weeks to see how much they could tolerate and how well it worked. Only people who experienced significant pain relief and could tolerate the medicine continued to the next phase. In this phase, some people were randomly assigned to continue using the fentanyl patch while others were given a fake patch (placebo) for 12 weeks. The study found that the fentanyl patch provided some pain relief for about 35% of people who were able to tolerate the medicine, compared to 22% who received the fake patch.  However, nearly 90% of the people experienced side effects like constipation, nausea, drowsiness, and dizziness, and many had to stop using the patch because of those side effects or because their pain wasnâ€™t getting better.	This study looked at whether a medicine called fentanyl could help people with postherpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, or long-term pain after surgery. They wanted to see if fentanyl could help people with these conditions. The study used a special patch called fentanyl to give people a dose of fentanyl over a period of 10 to 29 days. Then, they were randomly assigned to continue taking fentanyl or to take a placebo (a fake pill) for 12 weeks. The study found that only a small number of people who took fentanyl had good pain relief and were able to tolerate it. This means that fentanyl might be a good treatment for these conditions, but more research is needed to confirm this.
219	Hepatocellular carcinoma is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Hepatic resection is regarded as the curative therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. However, only about 20% of people with hepatocellular carcinoma are candidates for resection, which highlights the importance of effective nonsurgical therapies. Until now, transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is the most common palliative therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma, but its clinical benefits remain unsatisfactory. During recent years, some studies have reported that the combination of TACE plus thermal ablation can confer a more favourable prognosis than TACE alone. However, clear and compelling evidence to prove the beneficial or harmful effects of the combination of TACE and thermal ablation therapy is lacking.	Liver cancer, known as hepatocellular carcinoma, is a serious disease. Removing the part of the liver with cancer is the best treatment, but only about 20% of patients can have this surgery. This means other treatments are needed. The most common treatment for liver cancer is called transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation, or TACE, which uses medicine to kill the cancer cells. However, TACE doesn't always work well. Some studies suggest that combining TACE with another treatment called thermal ablation might be better, but there is not enough strong evidence to say for sure.	Hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatocellular carcinoma) is a type of cancer that affects the liver. It's the sixth most common cancer worldwide.

Recent studies have shown that combining TACE and thermal ablation can lead to a better prognosis than TACE alone. However, there isn't enough evidence to say whether the combination of TACE and thermal ablation is beneficial or harmful.
220	We identified 12 RCTs and one quasi-RCT (6923 participants), six for cardiac surgery (3359 participants) and seven for thoracic surgery (3564 participants). No study evaluated fondaparinux, the new oral direct thrombin, direct factor Xa inhibitors, or caval filters. All studies had major study design flaws and most lacked a placebo or no treatment control group. We typically graded the quality of the overall body of evidence for the various outcomes and comparisons as low, due to imprecise estimates of effect and risk of bias. We could not pool data because of the different comparisons and the lack of data. In cardiac surgery, 71 symptomatic VTEs occurred in 3040 participants from four studies. In a study of 2551 participants, representing 85% of the review population in cardiac surgery, the combination of unfractionated heparin with pneumatic compression stockings was associated with a 61% reduction of symptomatic VTE compared to unfractionated heparin alone (1.5% versus 4.0%; risk ratio (RR) 0.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.64). Major bleeding was only reported in one study, which found a higher incidence with vitamin K antagonists compared to platelet inhibitors (11.3% versus 1.6%, RR 7.06; 95% CI 1.64 to 30.40). In thoracic surgery, 15 symptomatic VTEs occurred in 2890 participants from six studies. In the largest study evaluating unfractionated heparin versus an inactive control the rates of symptomatic VTE were 0.7% versus 0%, respectively, giving a RR of 6.71 (95% CI 0.40 to 112.65). There was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference in the risk of major bleeding from two studies evaluating fixed-dose versus weight-adjusted low molecular weight heparin (2.7% versus 8.1%, RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.07 to 1.60) and unfractionated heparin versus low molecular weight heparin (6% and 4%, RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.26 to 8.60).	This study looked at different ways to prevent blood clots in people having heart or chest surgery. The researchers found that many studies on this topic had problems with their design, making it hard to draw firm conclusions. They also found that there wasn't enough data to compare all the different methods used to prevent blood clots. Overall, the evidence about what works best to prevent blood clots in these surgeries is weak. While some methods like wearing compression stockings along with regular heparin showed promising results in reducing blood clots, more research is needed to confirm these findings.	This study looked at the effects of different types of blood thinners (heparin) on people who have had heart surgery and thoracic surgery. They found 12 studies that compared different types of blood thinners, including fondaparinux, direct thrombin, direct factor Xa inhibitors, and caval filters. Most of the studies had problems with how they were designed, and they didn't include a placebo or no treatment at all. The quality of the evidence was considered low because the studies were too small and had some limitations. We couldn't combine the results because of the different studies and the lack of data. The study found that a combination of unfractionated heparin with pneumatic compression stockings was associated with a 61% reduction in symptomatic VTEs compared to unfractionated heparin alone. However, there was a higher risk of major bleeding with vitamin K antagonists compared to platelet inhibitors. The study also found that vitamin K antagonists were associated with a higher risk of major bleeding in thoracic surgery.
221	We included nine studies randomising 4514 women for meta-analysis and review. Overall results for the primary endpoint of PFS indicated that women receiving fulvestrant did at least as well as the control groups (hazard ratio (HR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.02; P = 0.18, I2= 56%, 4258 women, 9 studies, high-quality evidence). In the one high-quality study that tested fulvestrant at the currently approved and now standard dose of 500 mg against anastrozole, women treated with fulvestrant 500 mg did better than anastrozole, with a HR for TTP of 0.66 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.93; 205 women) and a HR for overall survival of 0.70 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.98; 205 women). There was no difference in PFS whether fulvestrant was used in combination with another endocrine therapy or in the first- or second-line setting, when compared to control treatments: for monotherapy HR 0.97 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.04) versus HR 0.87 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.99) for combination therapy when compared to control, and HR 0.93 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.03) in the first-line setting and HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.04) in the second-line setting. Overall, there was no difference between fulvestrant and control treatments in clinical benefit rate (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.10; P = 0.29, I2 = 24%, 4105 women, 9 studies, high-quality evidence) or overall survival (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.09, P = 0.62, I2 = 66%, 2480 women, 5 studies, high-quality evidence). There was no significant difference in vasomotor toxicity (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.18, 3544 women, 8 studies, high-quality evidence), arthralgia (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.09, 3244 women, 7 studies, high-quality evidence), and gynaecological toxicities (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.57, 2848 women, 6 studies, high-quality evidence). Four studies reported quality of life, none of which reported a difference between the fulvestrant and control arms, though specific data were not presented.	We looked at nine studies that included 4514 women. We found that fulvestrant worked as well as other treatments for breast cancer, but it did not work better. In one study, women who got fulvestrant at the highest dose did better than those who got a different medicine. We also found that fulvestrant worked just as well whether it was used alone or with other medicines, and whether it was used before or after other treatments.  Fulvestrant did not seem to cause more side effects than other treatments.	This study looked at whether a medicine called fulvestrant helps women live longer. The researchers reviewed nine studies that included 4514 women. They found that women who took fulvestrant did as well as those who didn't. They also found that fulvestrant was better than anastrozole in terms of how long they lived. However, fulvestrant didn't seem to make a difference in how long women lived compared to those who didn't. The study also found that fulvestrant didn't seem to cause any side effects like headaches, arthralgia, or gynecological problems.
222	Studies demonstrated no benefit of mirtazapine over placebo for pain relief of 50% or greater, PGIC, improvement of HRQoL of 20% or greater, or reduction of fatigue or negative mood. Clinically-relevant benefits were shown for pain relief of 30% or greater, reduction of mean pain intensity, and sleep problems. Somnolence, weight gain, and elevated alanine aminotransferase were more frequent with mirtazapine than placebo. The quality of evidence was low or very low, with two of three studies of questionable quality and issues over indirectness and risk of publication bias. On balance, any potential benefits of mirtazapine in fibromyalgia were outweighed by its potential harms, though, a small minority of people with fibromyalgia might experience substantial symptom relief without clinically-relevant adverse events.	This study looked at the effects of mirtazapine, a medicine, on people with fibromyalgia, a condition that causes widespread pain. The study found that mirtazapine didn't help much with pain relief, overall health, or fatigue, but it did help some people with pain and sleep problems. However, the study also found that mirtazapine had side effects like drowsiness, weight gain, and liver problems. Overall, the study suggests that the benefits of mirtazapine for fibromyalgia are likely outweighed by the risks, but some people may find it helpful.	This study looked at a medicine called mirtazapine for people with fibromyalgia, a condition that causes pain and stiffness. The study found that mirtazapine didn't seem to help people with fibromyalgia feel better than a placebo (a fake medicine). However, mirtazapine did seem to help people with fibromyalgia feel better and have fewer side effects. The study also found that mirtazapine might help people with fibromyalgia feel less tired, gain weight, and have a higher level of alanine aminotransferase. The quality of the evidence for mirtazapine in fibromyalgia was low or very low, with two of the three studies having questions about the quality of the evidence. Overall, the potential benefits of mirtazapine in fibromyalgia were outweighed by its potential risks. However, a small minority of people with fibromyalgia might experience significant symptom relief without any serious side effects.
223	"We included nine trials with low risk of bias, which assessed paracetamol for the treatment of pain in 728 infants. Painful procedures studied included heel lance, assisted vaginal birth, eye examination for retinopathy of prematurity assessment and postoperative care. Results of individual studies could not be combined in meta-analyses as the painful conditions, the use of paracetamol and comparison interventions and the outcome measures differed. Paracetamol compared with water, cherry elixir or EMLA cream (eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine) did not significantly reduce pain following heel lance. The Premature Infant Pain Profile score (PIPP) within three minutes following lancing was higher in the paracetamol group than in the oral glucose group (mean difference (MD) 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 3.70; one study, 38 infants). Paracetamol did not reduce ""modified facies scores"" after assisted vaginal birth (one study, 119 infants). In another study (n = 123), the Echelle de Douleur et d'Inconfort du Nouveau-Ne score at two hours of age was significantly higher in the group that received paracetamol suppositories than in the placebo suppositories group (MD 1.00, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.40). In that study, when infants were subjected to a heel lance at two to three days of age, Bernese Pain Scale for Neonates scores were higher in the paracetamol group than in the placebo group, and infants spent a longer time crying (MD 19 seconds, 95% CI 14 to 24). For eye examinations, no significant reduction in PIPP scores in the first or last 45 seconds of eye examination was reported, nor at five minutes after the eye examination. In one study (n = 81), the PIPP score was significantly higher in the paracetamol group than in the 24% sucrose group (MD 3.90, 95% CI 2.92 to 4.88). In one study (n = 114) the PIPP score during eye examination was significantly lower in the paracetamol group than in the water group (MD -2.70, 95% CI -3.55 to 1.85). For postoperative care following major surgery, the total amount of morphine (ug/kg) administered over 48 hours was significantly less among infants assigned to the paracetamol group than to the morphine group (MD -157 ug/kg, 95% CI -27 to -288). No adverse events were noted in any study. The quality of evidence according to GRADE was low."	We looked at nine studies that were well-designed, involving 728 babies. These studies looked at different painful procedures like heel pricking, assisted births, eye exams, and after surgery.  Because these studies were different, we couldn't combine the results. Paracetamol didn't reduce pain after heel pricking compared to water, sugar water, or another pain reliever. In one study, babies who got paracetamol had more pain after heel pricking compared to those who got sugar water. Paracetamol didn't help with pain after births. In one study, babies who got paracetamol had more pain after birth compared to those who didn't. Paracetamol may actually make some babies more sensitive to pain later on. In another study, babies who got paracetamol after surgery needed less morphine. No harmful effects were seen in any study. The overall quality of evidence was low.	This study looked at whether a medicine called paracetamol could help reduce pain in babies who had painful procedures like a heel lance, assisted vaginal birth, eye exams for retinopathy of prematurity, and post-operative care. The study found that paracetamol didn't significantly reduce pain after heel lance. It also didn't seem to reduce pain after assisted vaginal birth. The study also found that paracetamol didn't significantly reduce pain after assisted vaginal birth.
224	Fenoprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), available in several different countries, but not widely used. To assess the efficacy of single dose oral fenoprofen in acute postoperative pain, and associated adverse events. We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies to December 2010. Single oral dose, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of fenoprofen for relief of established moderate to severe postoperative pain in adults. Studies were assessed for methodological quality and data extracted by two review authors independently. Summed total pain relief (TOTPAR) or pain intensity difference (SPID) over 4 to 6 hours was used to calculate the number of participants achieving at least 50% pain relief. These derived results were used to calculate, with 95% confidence intervals, the relative benefit compared to placebo, and the number needed to treat (NNT) for one participant to experience at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours. Numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals was collected. Five studies (696 participants) met the inclusion criteria; 24 participants were treated with fenoprofen 12.5 mg, 23 with fenoprofen 25 mg, 79 with fenoprofen 50 mg, 78 with fenoprofen 100 mg, 146 with fenoprofen 200 mg, 55 with fenoprofen 300 mg, 43 with zomepirac 100 mg, 30 with morphine 8 mg, 77 with codeine 60 mg, and 141 with placebo. Participants had pain following third molar extraction, laparoscopy, minor day surgery and episiotomy. The NNT for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours with a single dose of fenoprofen 200 mg compared to placebo was 2.3 (1.9 to 3.0). There were insufficient data to analyse other doses or active comparators, time to use of rescue medication, or numbers of participants needing rescue medication. There was no difference in numbers of participants experiencing any adverse events between fenoprofen 200 mg and placebo. No serious adverse events or adverse event withdrawals were reported in these studies. Oral fenoprofen 200 mg is effective at treating moderate to severe acute postoperative pain, based on limited data for at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours. Efficacy of other doses, other efficacy outcomes, and safety and tolerability could not be assessed.	This study looked at how well a single dose of a pain reliever called fenoprofen works for acute (sudden) pain after surgery.  Fenoprofen is a type of medication called a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  The study found that a 200 mg dose of fenoprofen was effective at reducing pain by at least half for 4 to 6 hours compared to a placebo (a sugar pill that doesn't do anything).  However, there weren't enough data to see how well other doses worked or how safe it was.	This study looked at whether a single dose of fenoprofen helps people with pain after surgery. Fenoprofen is a medicine that helps reduce inflammation. It's available in many countries, but it's not widely used. The researchers wanted to see if a single dose of fenoprofen could help people with moderate to severe pain after surgery. They looked at studies that compared fenoprofen to a fake pill (placebo). They found that a single dose of fenoprofen helped people get at least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours. However, they didn't find any evidence that fenoprofen caused any side effects.
225	About 5% of women experience severe symptoms called premenstrual syndrome (PMS), only in the two weeks before their menstrual periods. Treatment with progesterone may restore a deficiency, balance menstrual hormone levels or reduce effects of falling progesterone levels on the brain or on electrolytes in the blood. The objectives were to determine if progesterone has been found to be an effective treatment for all or some premenstrual symptoms and if adverse events associated with this treatment have been reported. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO to February 2011. We contacted pharmaceutical companies for information about unpublished trials, for the first version of this review. The search strings are in Appendix 2. We included randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of progesterone on women with PMS diagnosed by at least two prospective cycles, without current psychiatric disorder. Two reviewers (BM and OF) extracted data independently and decided which trials to include. OF wrote to trial investigators for missing data. From 17 studies, only two met our inclusion criteria. Together they had 280 participants aged between 18 and 45 years. One hundred and fifteen yielded analysable results. Both studies measured symptom severity using subjective scales. Differing in design, participants, dose of progesterone and how delivered, the studies could not be combined in meta-analysis. Adverse events which may or may not have been side effects of the treatment were described as mild. Both trials had defects. They intended to exclude women whose symptoms continued after their periods. When data from ineligible women were excluded from analysis in one trial, the other women were found to have benefited more from progesterone than placebo. The smaller study found no statistically significant difference between oral progesterone, vaginally absorbed progesterone and placebo, but reported outcomes incompletely. The trials did not show that progesterone is an effective treatment for PMS nor that it is not. Neither trial distinguished a subgroup of women who benefited, nor examined claimed success with high doses.	About 5% of women experience severe symptoms called premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in the two weeks before their period.  Doctors think that PMS might be caused by changes in hormone levels, especially progesterone.  They have studied whether giving women progesterone as a treatment could help. This study looked at 17 different research papers on progesterone and PMS. Only two of these studies met the quality standards needed to be included in the review. These studies involved 280 women between the ages of 18 and 45 who were experiencing PMS. The studies found that some women might benefit from progesterone, but the results were not strong enough to say for sure if progesterone is a good treatment for PMS. The studies also didn't look at whether high doses of progesterone might be more effective.	This study looked at whether progesterone is a good treatment for premenstrual syndrome (PMS), a condition where women experience severe symptoms just before their periods. Progesterone is a hormone that helps regulate menstrual hormone levels. The study found only two studies that met our criteria. These studies included 280 women between the ages of 18 and 45. The results showed that progesterone may help restore a deficiency in progesterone, balance menstrual hormone levels, or reduce the effects of falling progesterone levels on the brain or blood. The study also found that progesterone might be helpful for some women with PMS, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.
226	We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 20 September 2019 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register were identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.	We looked for research studies about kidney transplant up to September 2019. We searched different medical databases like CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE, checked conference papers, and online trial registries like the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.	We searched for studies related to this review in a database called the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to September 20, 2019. We also looked at other databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
227	We found low-certainty evidence that behavioral waterpipe cessation interventions can increase waterpipe quit rates among waterpipe smokers. We found insufficient evidence to assess whether varenicline or bupropion increased waterpipe abstinence; available evidence is compatible with effect sizes similar to those seen for cigarette smoking cessation. Given e-health interventions' potential reach and effectiveness for waterpipe cessation, trials with large samples and long follow-up periods are needed. Future studies should use biochemical validation of abstinence to prevent the risk of detection bias. Finally, there has been limited attention given to high-risk groups for waterpipe smoking, such as youth, young adults, pregnant women, and dual or poly tobacco users. These groups would benefit from targeted studies.	We looked at studies on ways to help people stop smoking water pipes. We found some evidence that behavioral programs can help people quit, but we need more research on this. We didn't find enough evidence to say whether certain medications (varenicline or bupropion) help people stop smoking water pipes. We do know that using online programs to help people quit has potential, so we need more studies on this with lots of people and long follow-up periods. We need to make sure that studies are done right, so we can be sure that people are really quitting. Finally, we need to do more research on people who are at high risk of smoking water pipes, like young people, pregnant women, and people who smoke both cigarettes and water pipes.	We found that there isn't enough strong evidence to say whether giving people advice on quitting waterpipe smoking can help them quit. We also didn't find enough evidence to say whether a medicine called varenicline or bupropion helps people quit waterpipe smoking. We need more studies with large groups of people and long follow-up periods to be sure. We also need more research on high-risk groups like young adults, pregnant women, and people who smoke more than one type of tobacco. These groups would benefit from more targeted studies.
228	Various pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions have been used to suppress lactation after childbirth and relieve associated symptoms. Despite the large volume of literature on the subject, there is currently no universal guideline on the most appropriate approach for suppressing lactation in postpartum women. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of interventions used for suppression of lactation in postpartum women (who have not breastfed or expressed breastmilk) to determine which approach has the greatest comparative benefits with least risk. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2012). Randomised trials evaluating the effectiveness of treatments used for suppression of postpartum lactation. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We included 62 trials (6428 women). Twenty-two trials did not contribute data to the meta-analyses. The trials were generally small and of limited quality. Three trials (107 women) indicated that bromocriptine significantly reduced the proportion of women lactating compared with no treatment at or within seven days postpartum (three trials, 107 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.54). Seven trials involving oestrogen preparations (diethylstilbestrol, quinestrol, chlorotrianisene, hexestrol) suggested that they significantly reduced the proportion of lactating women compared with no treatment at or within seven days postpartum (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.56). We found no trials comparing non-pharmacologic methods with no treatment. Trials comparing bromocriptine with other pharmacologic agents such as methergoline, prostaglandins, pyridoxine, carbegoline, diethylstilbestrol and cyclofenil suggested similarity in their effectiveness. Side effects were poorly reported in the trials and no case of thromboembolism was recorded in the four trials that reported it as an outcome. There is weak evidence that some pharmacologic treatments (most of which are currently unavailable to the public) are better than no treatment for suppressing lactation symptoms in the first postpartum week. No evidence currently exists to indicate whether non-pharmacologic approaches are more effective than no treatment. Presently, there is insufficient evidence to address the side effects of methods employed for suppressing lactation. When women desire treatment, bromocriptine may be considered where it is registered for lactation suppression in those without predisposition to its major side effects of public concerns. Many trials did not contribute data that could be included in analyses. Large randomised trials are needed to compare the effectiveness of pharmacologic (especially bromocriptine) and non-pharmacologic methods with no treatment. Such trials should consider the acceptability of the intervention and lactation symptoms of concern to women and be large enough to detect clinically important differences in major side effects between comparison groups.	Many ways have been tried to stop breast milk production after giving birth and to ease the symptoms. While there are lots of studies on this topic, there's no clear agreement on the best way to stop breast milk production. This study aimed to find out which methods were most effective and safe for women who didn't plan to breastfeed. Researchers looked at a large number of studies involving different treatments, including medications like bromocriptine and estrogen, as well as non-medication methods.  They found that bromocriptine and estrogen seemed to reduce breast milk production compared to not using any treatment.  However, most of the studies were small and didn't have high quality data.  There were no studies comparing non-medication methods to no treatment.  The study also found that bromocriptine, estrogen, and other medications seemed to work similarly.  Side effects were not well reported in the studies.  More research is needed to understand which methods are best and safest for women. Larger studies are needed to compare different treatments with no treatment, taking into account women's preferences and potential side effects.	This study looked at different ways to help women who haven't breastfed or expressed breast milk stop lactation after childbirth. There's a lot of research on this topic, but there's no universal guideline on the best way to do it. Researchers looked at 62 studies that included 6428 women. They found that some medications, like bromocriptine, might help reduce the number of women lactating compared to no treatment. Others, like oestrogens, might also help reduce the number of women lactating compared to no treatment. However, there wasn't enough evidence to say for sure which non-medical methods are better than no treatment. Overall, there's not enough evidence to say whether non-medical approaches are better than no treatment.
229	Although tubal sterilization procedures are considered to be permanent, requests for reversal of the procedure (re-canalisation) are not infrequent. The reversal procedure can be done either by an open laparotomy or by minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic or robotic approach). To compare the relative effectiveness and safety of reversal of tubal sterilization by open laparotomy, laparoscopy and robotically assisted endoscopy. On 23 October 2012 we searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Review Group Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 10, 2012); MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS; clinical trials registries; regional databases; conference proceedings; and references for relevant published, unpublished and ongoing trials. Randomised trials comparing the different methods of surgical reversal of tubal sterilisation. No trials that met the selection criteria were identified. No data for evaluation were obtained Currently there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to recommend or refute the use of a minimally invasive surgical approach (laparoscopic or robotic) or open surgery for reversal of tubal sterilization. There is a need for well conducted and reported randomised clinical trials to generate reliable evidence to inform clinical practice.	Tubal sterilization is a permanent procedure that blocks the fallopian tubes, preventing pregnancy. Some people later decide they want to have children and ask for the procedure to be reversed. This reversal can be done using traditional open surgery, minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery, or robot-assisted surgery.  We reviewed many studies to compare the effectiveness and safety of these different reversal methods.  However, we found no studies that directly compared these methods in a reliable way.  Therefore, we cannot recommend one method over another.  More high-quality studies are needed to provide better information for doctors and patients.	This study looked at different ways to reverse a procedure called tubal sterilization. While tubal sterilization is considered permanent, there are often requests for it to be reversible (re-canalisation). The reversal procedure can be done either through an open laparotomy (open laparotomy) or by minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy or robotically assisted endoscopy). We searched for studies that compared the effectiveness and safety of different methods for reversal of tubal sterilization. We found no studies that met our criteria. We need more well-designed and reported clinical trials to provide reliable evidence.
230	Screening of abstracts and full-text publications, alongside data extraction and'Risk of bias' assessment, were done dually using the Covidence software. When we had sufficient data, we calculated random-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) meta-analyses; otherwise, we reported results narratively. We used the I2 statistic to analyse statistical heterogeneity. We planned to use funnel plots to assess publication bias in meta-analyses with at least 10 included studies. We dually rated the risk of bias of studies using the Cochrane'Risk of bias' tool, and the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.	We carefully reviewed many research papers about a topic. We used a special computer program to help us organize and analyze the data. We combined the results of the studies to see if there was a clear trend. We checked for any inconsistencies between the studies and tried to figure out if the way the studies were conducted might have influenced their results. We also assessed how reliable the evidence was.	We looked at a lot of research papers to see if there were any problems with how the studies were done. We used a special tool called Covidence to analyze the information. When we had enough data, we used a special method called meta-analysis to combine the results of different studies. We planned to use a special method called funnel plots to check if the studies were biased. We also rated the risk of bias in the studies using a tool called Cochrane'Risk of bias' and the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.
231	Two review authors independently classified studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Our primary outcomes were treatment success rate at three months (defined as residual fragments smaller than 4 mm, or as defined by the study authors), quality of life (QoL), and complications. Our secondary outcomes were retreatment rate, auxiliary procedures rate, and duration of hospital stay. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and independently rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.	Two researchers reviewed all the studies, sorted them into groups, collected information from them, and checked for any potential problems. The main things we looked at were how successful the treatment was after three months (whether the stones were gone or small enough), how well people felt (quality of life), and if there were any side effects. We also looked at how often people needed more treatment, how often they needed extra procedures, and how long they stayed in the hospital. We combined the results of all the studies and assessed how confident we were in the evidence.	Two researchers independently reviewed the studies, collected data, and assessed how reliable the studies were. We were mainly interested in how well the treatment worked after three months, how well people's quality of life was, and if there were any complications. We also looked at how often people had to stop the treatment, how often they needed additional procedures, and how long they stayed in the hospital. We used a statistical method called a random-effects model and rated the quality of the evidence using a system called GRADE.
232	The results of this systematic review cannot inform clinical practice as no suitable trials were identified for inclusion. Therefore, it is currently unknown whether these interventions offer any added value in this patient group or whether specific types of breathing exercise demonstrate superiority over others. Given that breathing exercises are frequently used to treat dysfunctional breathing/hyperventilation syndrome, there is an urgent need for well-designed clinical trials in this area. Future trials should conform to the CONSORT statement for standards of reporting and use validated outcome measures. Trial reports should also ensure full disclosure of data for all important clinical outcomes.	We can't use the results of this review to help doctors treat patients because we didn't find any suitable studies.  So, we don't know if these breathing exercises actually help people with breathing problems or if some types of exercises are better than others.  Since breathing exercises are commonly used to treat dysfunctional breathing and hyperventilation syndrome, we need more well-designed studies on this topic. Future studies should follow the CONSORT statement for reporting standards and use proven ways to measure outcomes.  They should also make sure to share all the important data from the studies.

233	We included 28 randomized clinical trials (9330 participants); in the 21 trials reporting relevant outcomes for this review, 7597 participants were randomly assigned to a high fraction of inspired oxygen versus a routine fraction of inspired oxygen. In trials with an overall low risk of bias, a high fraction of inspired oxygen compared with a routine fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all-cause mortality (random-effects model: RR 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.36; GRADE: low quality) within the longest follow-up and within 30 days of follow-up (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.60; GRADE: low quality). In a trial sequential analysis, the required information size was not reached and the analysis could not refute a 20% increase in mortality. Similarly, when all trials were included, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with all-cause mortality to the longest follow-up (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33) or within 30 days of follow-up (Peto OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.29), both of very low quality according to GRADE. Neither was a high fraction of inspired oxygen associated with the risk of surgical site infection in trials with low risk of bias (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.17; GRADE: low quality) or in all trials (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07; GRADE: low quality). A high fraction of inspired oxygen was not associated with respiratory insufficiency (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.99), serious adverse events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43) or length of stay (mean difference -0.06 days, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.32 days). In subgroup analyses of nine trials using preoperative antibiotics, a high fraction of inspired oxygen was associated with a decrease in surgical site infections (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; GRADE: very low quality); a similar effect was noted in the five trials adequately blinded for the outcome assessment (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; GRADE: very low quality). We did not observe an effect of a high fraction of inspired oxygen on surgical site infections in any other subgroup analyses.	This study looked at 28 different medical trials that involved over 9000 people. We were interested in seeing if giving people high levels of oxygen during surgery had any effects on their health. The results showed that high levels of oxygen didn't make a difference in whether people died or got infections after surgery. We also found that high oxygen levels didn't affect other things like how long people stayed in the hospital or how many serious side effects they had.  However, we did find that in some cases, high oxygen levels might actually help reduce infections, but more research is needed to confirm this.	This study looked at whether giving a high amount of oxygen during surgery was better than giving a normal amount of oxygen. They found that giving a high amount of oxygen didn't seem to increase the risk of death, serious side effects, or how long people stayed in the hospital. The study also found that giving a high amount of oxygen didn't seem to increase the risk of infections during surgery. The study also found that giving a high amount of oxygen during surgery didn't seem to increase the risk of breathing problems, serious side effects, or how long people stayed in the hospital. The study also found that giving a high amount of oxygen during surgery was associated with a decrease in infections during surgery.
234	To compare the relative effects (benefits and harms) of three injection techniques (single, double and multiple) of axillary block of the brachial plexus for distal upper extremity surgery. We considered these effects primarily in terms of anaesthetic effectiveness; the complication rate (neurological and vascular); and pain and discomfort caused by performance of the block.	This study is looking at how well different ways of injecting medicine into the shoulder work for surgery on the arm.  The study is looking at three different ways to give the medicine: a single injection, a double injection, and multiple injections. The study wants to see which method works best for numbing the arm, which method causes the fewest side effects, and which method is least painful for the patient.	This study aimed to compare the effects of three different injection techniques (single, double, and multiple) for a procedure called axillary block of the brachial plexus for distal upper extremity surgery. We looked at these effects in terms of how well the anesthetic worked, the number of complications (neurological and vascular), and the pain and discomfort caused by the surgery.

In the past 20 years, over 16 million people have been treated for leprosy globally. The condition's main complications are injuries and ulceration caused by sensory loss from nerve damage. In this review we explored interventions to prevent or treat secondary damage to the skin in people affected by leprosy (Hansen's disease). This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2008.	At the end of 2016, 145 countries told the World Health Organization (WHO) about over 173,000 new cases of leprosy around the world. In the last 20 years, over 16 million people have been treated for leprosy globally. The main problems caused by leprosy are injuries and sores on the skin because of nerve damage that makes people lose feeling.

238	"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The incidence of AD rises exponentially with age and its prevalence will increase significantly worldwide in the next few decades. Inflammatory processes have been suspected in the pathogenesis of the disease. To review the efficacy and side effects of aspirin, steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of AD, compared to placebo. We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 12 April 2011 using the terms: aspirin OR ""cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor"" OR aceclofenac OR acemetacin OR betamethasone OR celecoxib OR cortisone OR deflazacort OR dexamethasone OR dexibruprofen OR dexketoprofen OR diclofenac sodium OR diflunisal OR diflusinal OR etodolac OR etoricoxib OR fenbufen OR fenoprofen OR flurbiprofen OR hydrocortisone OR ibuprofen OR indometacin OR indomethacin OR ketoprofen OR lumiracoxib OR mefenamic OR meloxicam OR methylprednisolone OR nabumetone OR naproxen OR nimesulide OR ""anti-inflammatory"" OR prednisone OR piroxicam OR sulindac OR tenoxicam OR tiaprofenic acid OR triamcinolone OR NSAIDS OR NSAID. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries (including national, international and pharmacuetical registries) and grey literature sources. All randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy of aspirin, steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in AD. One author assessed risk of bias of each study and extracted data. A second author verified data selection. Our search identified 604 potentially relevant studies. Of these, 14 studies (15 interventions) were RCTs and met our inclusion criteria. The numbers of participants were 352, 138 and 1745 for aspirin, steroid and NSAIDs groups, respectively. One selected study comprised two separate interventions. Interventions assessed in these studies were grouped into four categories: aspirin (three interventions), steroids (one intervention), traditional NSAIDs (six interventions), and selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (five interventions). All studies were evaluated for internal validity using a risk of bias assessment tool. The risk of bias was low for five studies, high for seven studies, and unclear for two studies.There was no significant improvement in cognitive decline for aspirin, steroid, traditional NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors. Compared to controls, patients receiving aspirin experienced more bleeding while patients receiving steroid experienced more hyperglycaemia, abnormal lab results and face edema. Patients receiving NSAIDs experienced nausea, vomiting, elevated creatinine, elevated LFT and hypertension. A trend towards higher death rates was observed among patients treated with NSAIDS compared with placebo and this was somewhat higher for selective COX-2 inhibitors than for traditional NSAIDs. Based on the studies carried out so far, the efficacy of aspirin, steroid and NSAIDs (traditional NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors) is not proven. Therefore, these drugs cannot be recommended for the treatment of AD."	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a very common type of dementia, which means it affects people's thinking, memory, and ability to do daily activities. As people get older, they are more likely to get AD. In the next few decades, many more people around the world will develop this disease. Some scientists think that inflammation, which is a natural response to injury or infection, might be involved in causing AD.  This study looked at whether common medications like aspirin, steroids, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could help people with AD.  They reviewed many studies that compared these medications to a placebo (a fake pill) to see if they improved cognitive function (thinking and memory) or had any side effects. They found that none of these medications helped improve thinking or memory in people with AD. In fact, some of these medications were linked to some side effects, such as bleeding, high blood sugar, and other problems. Overall, the study concluded that there is no proof that these medications are effective for treating AD and they shouldn't be used to treat it.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common type of dementia. It's becoming more common as we get older, and it's expected to become more common worldwide in the next few decades. Researchers wanted to see if aspirin, a type of medicine that reduces inflammation, could help people with AD. They looked at studies that compared aspirin to a placebo (a fake pill). They found 604 studies that met their criteria. These studies showed that aspirin, a type of medicine, can help people with AD. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings.
239	1. To assess whether any ASM is more or less effective than an alternative ASM (both ASMs used as first-, second- or third-line treatment) in achieving seizure control and improving neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates with seizures. We analysed EEG-confirmed seizures and clinically-diagnosed seizures separately. 2. To assess maintenance therapy with ASM versus no maintenance therapy after achieving seizure control. We analysed EEG-confirmed seizures and clinically-diagnosed seizures separately. 3. To assess treatment of both clinical and electrographic seizures versus treatment of clinical seizures alone in neonates.	This study aims to figure out if certain medications for seizures (called ASMs) work better than others for babies with seizures. We'll look at two types of seizures: those confirmed by brainwave tests (EEG) and those diagnosed based on symptoms. We'll also see if giving these medications after a seizure is controlled helps keep seizures away. And lastly, we'll see if treating both brainwave seizures and visible seizures is better than just treating the visible ones.	This study aims to find out if a specific type of medication (ASM) is better or worse than another type of medication (both ASMs used as first, second, or third-line treatment) at controlling seizures and improving brain development in newborns with seizures. We will look at EEG-confirmed seizures and clinically-diagnosed seizures separately. We will also look at maintenance therapy with ASM versus no maintenance therapy after achieving seizure control. We will also look at EEG-confirmed seizures and clinically-diagnosed seizures separately. We will also look at treatment of both clinical and electrographic seizures versus treatment of clinical seizures alone in newborns.
240	We included randomised trials with at least 50% of the participants with established arterial occlusive events. We included trials investigating interventions using short message service (SMS) or multimedia messaging service (MMS) with the aim to improve adherence to medication for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Eligible comparators were no intervention or other modes of communication.	We included studies where at least half of the participants had already had a blockage in their arteries. We were interested in studies that looked at using text messages (SMS) or multimedia messages (MMS) to encourage people to take their medications to prevent another heart problem. We compared these studies to studies that didn't use any intervention or used other ways of communicating with patients.	This study looked at whether using short messages (SMS) or multimedia messaging (MMS) could help people take their medications more often to prevent heart problems. We only included studies where at least half of the participants had already had heart problems. We included studies that used short message service (SMS) or multimedia messaging service (MMS) to help people take their medications more often. We didn't include studies that used any other communication methods.
241	We identified eligible trials by searching MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. We searched the trials registers WHO ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of last search for all databases was 27 October 2015. We also examined reference lists of included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews, and contacted trial authors.	We looked for studies that met our criteria by searching several databases including MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. We also searched the WHO ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov, which are websites that list ongoing clinical trials. The last time we searched all these databases was October 27, 2015. We also looked at the lists of references from the studies we included and from previous reviews, and we contacted the authors of some studies to ask for more information.

242	Although we were able to calculate one estimation of DTA in, especially, the prediction of progression from MCI to ADD at four years follow-up, the small number of participants implies imprecision of sensitivity and specificity estimates. We cannot make any recommendation regarding the routine use of 18F-florbetaben in clinical practice based on one single study with 45 participants. 18F-florbetaben has high financial costs, therefore, clearly demonstrating its DTA and standardising the process of the 18F-florbetaben modality are important prior to its wider use.	Even though we were able to estimate how well this special brain scan (PET scan) could predict who would develop Alzheimer's Disease (ADD), the small number of participants makes the results uncertain.  We can't recommend using this scan routinely because it is very expensive and we need more research before we can be sure it's worth the cost.	This study looked at a drug called 18F-florbetaben, which is used to treat ADD. The study found that 18F-florbetaben has a high cost, so it's important to show how effective it is and to make sure it's used in a way that's easy to understand.
243	Chronic deep venous insufficiency is caused by incompetent vein valves, blockage of large-calibre leg veins, or both; and causes a range of symptoms including recurrent ulcers, pain and swelling. Most surgeons accept that well-fitted graduated compression stockings (GCS) and local care of wounds serve as adequate treatment for most people, but sometimes symptoms are not controlled and ulcers recur frequently, or they do not heal despite compliance with conservative measures. In these situations, in the presence of severe venous dysfunction, surgery has been advocated by some vascular surgeons. This is an update of the review first published in 2000.	Deep vein insufficiency is a condition where the valves in the veins of your legs don't work properly, or there is a blockage in the large veins in your legs. This can cause symptoms like sores that keep coming back, pain, and swelling.  Most doctors believe that wearing compression stockings and taking care of any wounds are enough to treat most people, but sometimes these methods don't work and the sores keep coming back. In these cases, some doctors may recommend surgery. This is a review of a previous study published in 2000.	Chronic deep vein insufficiency (DVI) is a condition where the blood vessels in your legs don't work properly. It's caused by problems with vein valves, blockages in large leg veins, or both. This can cause a range of symptoms, including ulcers, pain, and swelling. Most surgeons agree that well-fitted graduated compression stockings (GCS) and local care of wounds are good treatments for most people, but sometimes symptoms aren't controlled, ulcers come back often, or they don't heal despite taking conservative measures. In these situations, some vascular surgeons have advocated surgery. This is an updated version of a review first published in 2000.
244	We found low quality evidence that local steroid injections compared with placebo or no treatment may slightly reduce heel pain up to one month but not subsequently. The available evidence for other outcomes of this comparison was very low quality. Where available, the evidence from comparisons of steroid injections with other interventions used to treat heel pain and of different methods of guiding the injection was also very low quality. Although serious adverse events relating to steroid injection were rare, these were under-reported and a higher risk cannot be ruled out. Further research should focus on establishing the effects (benefits and harms) of injected steroids compared with placebo in typical clinical settings, subsequent to a course of unsuccessful conservative therapy. Ideally, this should be preceded by research, including patient involvement, aimed to obtain consensus on the priority questions for treating plantar heel pain.	Steroid injections in the heel might help reduce pain for a short time (up to one month), but not after that. We don't know much about whether these injections help with other problems or how they compare to other treatments for heel pain. While serious side effects from these injections are rare, they are underreported, so we can't rule out a higher risk. More research is needed to understand the benefits and risks of steroid injections compared to placebo, especially after other treatments have failed. We also need to figure out the most important questions patients have about treating heel pain.	This study looked at whether giving local steroid injections to people with plantar heel pain (plantar heel pain) is better than giving them a fake treatment (placebo) or no treatment at all. The study found that local steroid injections might slightly reduce heel pain for a month, but not for a month later. The evidence for other outcomes of this comparison was also very weak. The evidence for comparing steroid injections to other treatments for heel pain and different ways to guide the injection was also very weak. While serious side effects related to steroid injections were rare, these were underreported and a higher risk cannot be ruled out. More research is needed to understand the effects (benefits and harms) of injected steroids compared to placebo in typical clinical settings, after a course of unsuccessful conservative therapy. Ideally, this should be preceded by research, including patient involvement, to get a consensus on the priorities for treating plantar heel pain.
245	Owing to a paucity of eligible trials, as well as diversity in the intervention type, comorbidities and the outcome measures reported, we were unable to provide a robust synthesis of data. Pulmonary rehabilitation or multicomponent interventions may improve quality of life and functional status (6MWD), but the evidence is too limited to draw a robust conclusion. The key take-home message from this review is the lack of data from RCTs on treatments for people living with COPD and comorbidities. Given the variation in number and type of comorbidity(s) an individual may have, and severity of COPD, larger studies reporting individual patient data are required to determine these effects.	We looked at many studies on treatments for people with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) who also have other health problems.  Unfortunately, there weren't enough good studies to give us a clear answer on whether treatments like pulmonary rehabilitation (special exercise programs) or multicomponent interventions (treatments that combine different approaches) can help improve quality of life and how well people can function.  We need more studies with lots of participants and detailed information on each person to better understand these treatments.	This review looked at different treatments for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other health problems. The review found that there isn't enough evidence to say for sure if these treatments actually improve quality of life and function. The review also highlighted the need for more research to understand how these treatments work for people with COPD and other health problems.

247	Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is characterised by progressive, predominantly distal, asymmetrical limb weakness and usually multiple partial motor nerve conduction blocks. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is beneficial but the role of immunosuppressive agents is uncertain. This is an update of a review first published in 2002 and previously updated in 2003, 2005, 2008 and 2011.	Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a condition that causes weakness in the arms and legs, usually starting in the hands and feet. The weakness is usually worse on one side of the body than the other. People with MMN often have problems with their nerves, making it hard for the nerves to send signals properly. A medicine called intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) helps some people with MMN, but itâ€™s not clear if other medicines that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants) are helpful.  This is an updated review of research on MMN, which was first published in 2002 and has been updated several times since.	Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a condition that affects the motor nerves in the legs. It's a progressive, mostly distal, asymmetrical weakness in the legs and often causes multiple partial motor nerve conduction blocks. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is used to treat MNM, but the role of immunosuppressive agents is unclear. This is an updated version of a review first published in 2002 and previously updated in 2003, 2005, 2008, and 2011.
248	The additional pain reduction at rest associated with the use of EA rather than IVPCA is modest and unlikely to be clinically important. Single-trial estimates provide low-quality evidence that there may be an additional reduction in pain on movement, which is clinically important. Any improvement needs to be interpreted with the understanding that the use of EA is also associated with an increased chance of failure to successfully institute analgesia, and an increased likelihood of episodes of hypotension requiring intervention and pruritus. We have rated the evidence as of moderate quality given study limitations in most of the contributing studies. Further large RCTs are required to determine the ideal analgesic technique. The 10 studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.	This study looked at whether using electrical stimulation (EA) to reduce pain is better than using a pump that lets patients give themselves pain medicine (IVPCA). The study found that EA might slightly reduce pain at rest, but the difference isn't big enough to be important. However, EA may slightly reduce pain during movement, which could be important. It's important to remember that using EA also makes it more likely that pain relief won't work, that your blood pressure will drop, and that you'll get itchy. Overall, the evidence is okay, but more research is needed to figure out the best way to manage pain.	This study looked at whether using EA instead of IVPCA can help reduce pain at rest. The results suggest that EA might slightly reduce pain at rest, but it's unlikely to be very important. There's also some evidence that EA might help reduce pain when moving, which is important. However, any improvement needs to be interpreted with the understanding that EA is also associated with a higher chance of failure to successfully initiate analgesia, and a higher chance of episodes of low blood pressure requiring intervention and pruritus. Overall, the evidence is considered moderate quality due to limitations in most studies. More large studies are needed to determine the best analgesic technique. The 10 studies awaiting classification may change the conclusions of the review once assessed.
249	We found low-certainty evidence from studies of good methodological quality that lactoferrin supplementation of enteral feeds decreases late-onset sepsis (both suspected and confirmed, and confirmed only) but not NEC >= stage II or'all cause mortality' or neurodevelopmental outcomes at 24 months of age in preterm infants without adverse effects. Low- to very low-certainty evidence suggests that lactoferrin supplementation of enteral feeds in combination with probiotics decreases late-onset sepsis (data from confirmed sepsis only) and NEC >= stage II in preterm infants without adverse effects, however, there were few included studies of poor methodological quality. The presence of publication bias and small studies of poor methodology that may inflate the effect size make recommendations for clinical practice difficult.	Another study found that lactoferrin in milk might help prevent late-onset sepsis in premature babies without causing any harm. This study also found that giving lactoferrin with probiotics (good bacteria) might help prevent late-onset sepsis and NEC (a bowel problem) in premature babies. However, this study only included a few babies, and it wasn't very well designed, so we need more research to be sure.	This study looked at whether giving lactoferrin to premature babies in combination with probiotics helps prevent sepsis, a serious infection in the womb, in premature babies. The study found that lactoferrin might help prevent sepsis, but the evidence wasn't strong enough to say for sure. The study also found that lactoferrin might help prevent sepsis in premature babies, but the evidence wasn't strong enough to say for sure. The study also found that lactoferrin might help prevent sepsis in premature babies, but the evidence wasn't strong enough to say for sure. The study also found that there wasn't enough good quality studies to say for sure if lactoferrin is helpful.
250	Pain is the most frequent symptom experienced by cancer patients, its intensity dependent on the site of the tumour. Tumours that compromise bone or nervous structures due to the bone destruction process are the most painful. There are several treatments to deal with pain (and other symptoms) caused by bone metastases. The hormone calcitonin has the potential to relieve pain and also retain bone density, thus reducing the risk of fractures. This review is an update of a previously published review in theCochrane Library (2003, Issue 3) which was also updated in 2006 (Issue 3) and in 2011 (Issue 9). The main objective of the review is to determine the effectiveness of calcitonin to reduce metastatic bone pain in patients with painful bone metastases. Secondary objectives are to assess the benefits of calcitonin in reducing the incidence of bone complications (hypercalcemia, fractures and nervous compression) and improving patient survival, and to report any adverse effects of the treatment. We updated the electronic searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE up to February 2015. We also searched registers of clinical trials in progress up to February 2015. We included studies if they were randomised, double-blind clinical trials of patients with metastatic bone pain, treated with calcitonin, where the major outcome measure was pain, assessed at four weeks or longer. Two independent review authors performed study selection and data extraction. Only two studies (90 participants) were eligible for inclusion in the review and therefore meta-analysis of the data was not possible. We performed intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis by imputing all missing values as adverse effects. The overall quality of the evidence was very low. In this update no new studies were identified for inclusion; one additional study was excluded. Of the two small included studies, one study showed a non-significant effect of calcitonin on the number of patients with complete pain relief (risk ratio (RR) 2.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 11.41). The second study provided no evidence that calcitonin reduced analgesia consumption (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21) in patients with painful bone metastases. There was no evidence that calcitonin was effective in controlling complications due to bone metastases, for improving quality of life or for patients' survival. Although not statistically significant, a greater number of adverse effects were observed in the groups given calcitonin in the two included studies (RR 3.50; 95% CI 0.77 to 15.88). Current available research evidence is of very low quality and there is a lack of evidence to support the use of calcitonin for managing bone pain from bone metastases. Since the last version of this review, we did not identify any additional studies.	Pain is a common problem for people with cancer. The pain is worse when the cancer affects the bones or nerves.  There are different ways to treat pain caused by cancer in the bones. One treatment is a hormone called calcitonin. Calcitonin might help ease pain and strengthen bones, which reduces the risk of fractures.  Researchers looked at studies to see if calcitonin was helpful for cancer patients with bone pain.  They found only two small studies with a total of 90 patients. These studies didn't provide enough evidence to say if calcitonin was effective in reducing bone pain or preventing bone complications.  Furthermore, calcitonin might have some side effects.  More research is needed to understand if calcitonin is a useful treatment for bone pain from cancer.	This study looked at whether a medicine called calcitonin can help reduce pain caused by cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. The study found that calcitonin might help reduce pain and keep bone density, which can reduce the risk of fractures. However, there wasn't enough evidence to say for sure if calcitonin is effective in reducing pain in people with cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. The study also found that calcitonin didn't seem to reduce pain in people with cancer that had spread to other parts of the body. The study also found that calcitonin didn't seem to reduce pain in people with cancer that had spread to other parts of the body. More research is needed to determine if calcitonin is effective in reducing pain in people with cancer that have spread to other parts of the body.
251	Humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHFNC) delivers humidified gas at increased flow rates via binasal prongs and is becoming widely accepted as a method of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants. While indications for the use of (HHFNC) and its associated risks and benefits are being investigated, the best strategy for the discontinuation of HHFNC remains unknown. At what point an infant is considered stable enough to attempt to start withdrawing their HHFNC is not known. The criteria for a failed attempt at HHFNC discontinuation is also unclear.	Humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHFNC) is a breathing support treatment where humidified air is given to babies through their noses. It's becoming a common treatment for premature babies. While we're still learning how to use HHFNC and its risks and benefits, we don't know the best way to stop using it. It's unclear when a baby is stable enough to start weaning them off HHFNC. We also don't know what signs mean that stopping HHFNC hasn't worked.	Humidified high flow nasal cannula (HHFNC) delivers humidified gas at increased flow rates through binasal prongs and is becoming widely accepted as a non-invasive respiratory support for premature infants. While indications for the use of (HHFNC) and its associated risks and benefits are being investigated, the best strategy for discontinuing HHFNC remains unknown. At what point an infant is considered stable enough to attempt to start withdrawing their HHFNC is not known. The criteria for a failed attempt at discontinuation is also unclear.
252	Based on very low-certainty evidence in our systematic review, we are very uncertain of the role of exercise training (aerobic, resistance-based exercises, or both) in affecting mortality, health-related quality of life, and physical function (i.e. aerobic capacity and muscle strength) in liver transplant recipients. There were few data on the composite of cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease post-transplantation, and adverse event outcomes. We lack larger trials with blinded outcome assessment, designed according to the SPIRIT statement and reported according to the CONSORT statement.	We looked at studies to see if exercise helps people who have had liver transplants. We are not sure if exercise helps these people live longer, feel better, or improve their physical abilities. We need more research with larger groups of people and better ways of measuring the results.	We looked at a lot of studies to see if exercise training (aerobic, resistance-based, or both) helps people who have had a liver transplant live longer, have a better quality of life, and have more strength in their muscles. We didn't have enough information to say for sure if exercise training helps people who have had a liver transplant live longer, have a better quality of life, or have fewer side effects. We also didn't have enough information to know if exercise training helps people who have had a liver transplant live longer, have a better quality of life, or have a better quality of life. We also don't have enough information to say for sure if exercise training helps people who have had a liver transplant live longer, have a better quality of life, or have fewer side effects. We also don't have enough larger studies that look at how exercise training affects people's health after they have had a liver transplant.
253	Despite modern antimicrobials and supportive therapy, bacterial and fungal infections are still major complications in people with prolonged disease-related or therapy-related neutropenia. Since the late 1990s there has been increasing demand for donated granulocyte transfusions to treat or prevent severe infections in people who lack their own functional granulocytes. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009.	Even with modern medicines and treatments, bacterial and fungal infections are still a big problem for people who have a low white blood cell count for a long time due to their illness or the treatment they are receiving. Since the late 1990s, there has been a growing need for donated white blood cell transfusions to treat or prevent serious infections in people who don't have enough of their own white blood cells. This review updates a previous one from 2009.	Even with modern antibiotics and supportive treatments, bacteria and fungal infections are still a major problem for people with long-term neutropenia, which is a condition where the immune system doesn't respond well to treatment. Since the late 1990s, there's been a growing demand for donated granulocyte transfusions to treat or prevent serious infections in people who don't have their own healthy granulocytes. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2009.
254	Participants were adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity. Eligible interventions were integrated smartphone apps using at least two behaviour change techniques. The intervention could target physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, weight loss, healthy diet, or self-efficacy. Comparators included no or minimal intervention (NMI), a different smartphone app, personal coaching, or usual care. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials of any duration with a follow-up of at least three months.	This study included adolescents and adults who were overweight or obese. The study looked at smartphone apps that used at least two methods to encourage healthy changes. These apps focused on things like physical activity, improving heart and lung health, losing weight, eating healthy, and building self-confidence. The study compared these apps to not having any intervention, using a different smartphone app, having a personal coach, or receiving usual care. The study only included randomized controlled trials that lasted at least three months.	This study looked at how using smartphone apps could help people who are overweight or obese. They wanted to see if these apps could help them get more exercise, lose weight, eat healthier, or feel more confident in themselves. The studies included teenagers and adults who were overweight or obese. The apps could be used to help people with physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, weight loss, or self-efficacy. The studies compared different ways of using the apps, including no or minimal intervention, a different app, personal coaching, or usual care. The studies had a follow-up period of at least three months.
255	There is limited evidence, based on a number of trials, that the augmentation of antipsychotics with valproate may be effective for overall clinical response, and also for specific symptoms, especially in terms of excitement and aggression. However, this evidence was entirely based on open RCTs. Moreover, valproate was associated with a number of adverse events among which sedation and dizziness appeared significantly more frequently than in the control groups. Further randomised studies which are blinded are necessary before any clear recommendation can be made. Ideally these would focus on people with schizophrenia and aggression, on those with treatment-resistant forms of the illness and on those with schizoaffective disorders.	There's some evidence that adding valproate to antipsychotics might help people with mental illness, especially those with problems like agitation and aggression. But this evidence only comes from studies where everyone knew who was getting valproate.  Also, valproate was linked to some side effects, like feeling sleepy and dizzy, that were more common than in the groups who didn't take it. We need more research, where neither the participants nor the researchers know who's getting valproate, before we can say for sure if it's a good treatment.	There isn't a lot of strong evidence that adding valproate to antipsychotic medications can help people with schizophrenia and aggression. Some studies suggest that adding valproate might help with overall symptoms and specific symptoms, especially in terms of excitement and aggression. However, this evidence was only based on open-label studies. Moreover, valproate was associated with a number of side effects, including sedation and dizziness. More research is needed to make a clear recommendation. Ideally, these studies should focus on people with schizophrenia and aggression, those with treatment-resistant forms of the illness, and those with schizoaffective disorders.
256	The effect of TCCMD for most outcomes is uncertain. There may be improvements for some outcomes using targeted communication but these findings were of low certainty. High-quality, adequately powered trials and cost-effectiveness analyses are required to reliably ascertain the effects and relative benefits of TCCMD. Future studies should measure potential unintended consequences, such as partner violence or breaches of confidentiality.	We don't know for sure if a type of therapy called TCCMD helps people with many problems. There might be some improvement in a few areas if TCCMD is used with specific ways to communicate, but even then, the evidence is not strong. To know for sure if TCCMD is helpful and if it's worth the cost, we need more research projects with a large number of people and that are carefully designed.  We also need to look into whether there are any unintended side effects of TCCMD, like increased violence or privacy issues.	We don't know for sure if TCCMD helps with most things. It might help with some things, but we don't know for sure. We need more high-quality studies with enough participants and cost-effectiveness analyses to be sure about the effects and benefits of TCCMD. Future studies should also look at potential unintended consequences, like partner violence or confidentiality breaches.
257	Limited, low-certainty evidence suggests that moxibustion treatment may help to reduce the haematological and gastrointestinal toxicities of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, improving QoL in people with cancer; however, the evidence is not conclusive, and we cannot rule out benefits or risks with this treatment. High-quality studies that report adverse effects are needed.	There's not enough good evidence to say for sure whether a traditional Chinese medicine treatment called moxibustion helps people with cancer feel better. It might help reduce some side effects of chemotherapy and radiation, but we need more research to be sure.	There is limited, low-quality evidence suggesting that moxibustion treatment might help reduce the side effects of chemotherapy or radiation therapy, improving quality of life for people with cancer. However, the evidence is not conclusive, and we cannot rule out benefits or risks with this treatment. We need more high-quality studies that report side effects.
258	None of the included studies reported one of this review's primary outcomes: severe PPH >= 1000 mL. Only one study reported on maternal death or severe morbidity. There were limited secondary outcome data for maternal outcomes and very few secondary outcome data for neonatal outcomes. There was no clear differences between nipple stimulation (suckling) versus no treatment in relation to maternal death, the incidence of PPH (>= 500 mL), blood loss in the third stage of labour, retained placenta, perinatal deaths or maternal readmission to hospital. Whilst these data are based on a single study with a reasonable sample size, the quality of these data are mostly low or very low. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effect of nipple stimulation for reducing postpartum haemorrhage during the third stage of labour and more evidence from high-quality studies is needed. Further high-quality studies should recruit adequate sample sizes, assess the impact of nipple stimulation compared to uterotonic agents such as syntometrine and oxytocin, and report on important outcomes such as those listed in this review.	This review looked at the effects of nipple stimulation (suckling) during childbirth to help reduce postpartum bleeding. However, most of the studies reviewed didn't look at severe bleeding (more than 1000 mL) or deaths and serious complications related to childbirth. The few studies that did look at these outcomes were of low quality.  We didn't find enough good evidence to say whether nipple stimulation helps reduce bleeding after childbirth. We need more high-quality studies to understand this better. These studies should also compare nipple stimulation with other methods used to control bleeding after childbirth, like giving medications.	This study looked at whether nipple stimulation (suckling) helps reduce bleeding after childbirth. The study found that there isn't enough good evidence to say whether nipple stimulation helps reduce bleeding during labor. More high-quality studies are needed to see if nipple stimulation is better than other treatments like syntometrine and oxytocin.
259	Azathioprine is used for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, but the therapeutic responses in randomised clinical trials have been conflicting. To assess the benefits and harms of azathioprine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Randomised clinical trials were identified by searching The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, The Chinese Biomedical Database, and LILACS, and manual searches of bibliographies to September 2005. Randomised clinical trials comparing azathioprine versus placebo, no intervention, or another drug were included irrespective of blinding, language, year of publication, and publication status. Our primary outcomes were mortality, and mortality or liver transplantation. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous outcomes were reported as weighted mean difference (WMD) or standardised mean difference (SMD). We examined the intervention effects by random-effects and fixed-effect models. We identified two randomised clinical trials with 293 patients. Only one of the trials was regarded as having low bias risk. Azathioprine did not significantly decrease mortality (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.31, 2 trials). Azathioprine did not improve pruritus at one-year intervention (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.84, 1 trial), cirrhosis development, or quality of life. Patients given azathioprine experienced significantly more adverse events than patients given no intervention or placebo (RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.14 to 5.20, 2 trials). The common adverse events were rash, severe diarrhoea, and bone marrow depression. There is no evidence to support the use of azathioprine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Researchers who are interested in performing further randomised clinical trials should be aware of the risks of adverse events.	Azathioprine is a medicine used to treat people with primary biliary cirrhosis, a liver disease. However, studies on whether this medicine actually helps have shown conflicting results. We reviewed many studies to see if azathioprine helps patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. We looked at whether it helped people live longer or reduced the need for a liver transplant. We also looked at whether it caused any side effects. Our findings suggest that azathioprine does not improve survival or the need for liver transplantation in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. It also did not improve itching, a common symptom of this disease. However, patients taking azathioprine experienced more side effects, such as rashes, severe diarrhea, and problems with bone marrow. Based on this evidence, we do not recommend the use of azathioprine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Further research is needed to understand the potential risks and benefits of this medicine.	This study looked at whether a drug called azathioprine can help people with a condition called primary biliary cirrhosis (cirrhosis of the liver). The study found that azathioprine didn't seem to help people live longer, get rid of their bile ducts, or improve their quality of life. It also caused more side effects than people who didn't take azathioprine or a fake pill (placebo). Overall, the study found no evidence that azathioprine is a good treatment for biliary cirrhosis. More research is needed to understand the risks and benefits of azathioprine for people with biliary cirrhosis.
260	To evaluate the safety and efficacy of non-pharmacological treatment of infants at risk for, or having symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal on the length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment for symptom management. Comparison 1: in infants at risk for, or having early symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal, does non-pharmacological treatment reduce the length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment? Comparison 2: in infants receiving pharmacological treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, does concurrent non-pharmacological treatment reduce duration of pharmacological treatment, maximum and cumulative doses of opioid medication, and length of hospitalization?	This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatment for infants who are at risk of, or experiencing symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal. The researchers are looking at two main comparisons: 1) in infants who are at risk of, or showing early signs of, opioid withdrawal, does non-pharmacological treatment reduce the length of hospital stay and the need for medication? 2) in infants who are already receiving medication for opioid withdrawal, does adding non-pharmacological treatment reduce the length of time they need medication, the highest dose they receive, the total amount of medication they receive, and the length of their hospital stay?	This study aims to understand how safe and effective non-pharmacological treatment is for babies who are at risk for, or have symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal. The study aims to see if non-pharmacological treatment reduces the length of hospitalization and use of pharmacological treatment for symptom management. The study compares non-pharmacological treatment to pharmacological treatment for babies at risk for, or having early symptoms consistent with, opioid withdrawal. The study also compares non-pharmacological treatment to pharmacological treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal. The study also compares non-pharmacological treatment to pharmacological treatment for symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, and whether non-pharmacological treatment reduces the duration of pharmacological treatment, maximum and cumulative doses of opioid medication, and length of hospitalization.
261	Vitamin B12 deficiency is a major public health problem worldwide, with the highest burden in elderly people, pregnant women, and young children. Due to its role in DNA synthesis and methylation, folate metabolism, and erythropoiesis, vitamin B12 supplementation during pregnancy may confer longer-term benefits to maternal and child health outcomes.	Not having enough vitamin B12 is a big health problem all over the world. It's especially common in older people, pregnant women, and young children. Vitamin B12 is important for making DNA, processing folate, and making red blood cells. So, giving pregnant women vitamin B12 might help their health and the health of their babies in the long run.	Vitamin B12 deficiency is a major health problem worldwide, especially affecting older people, pregnant women, and young children. Vitamin B12 plays a vital role in DNA synthesis and methylation, folate metabolism, and erythropoiesis. Taking vitamin B12 during pregnancy can have long-term benefits for both mothers and children.
262	Both review authors independently assessed and extracted the data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes of the review were the incidence of early and late POVCH following perioperative anti-VEGF administration. Secondary outcomes included best-corrected visual acuity at six months following surgery, the incidence of vitreous cavity washout or revision vitrectomy at six months, adverse effects of intervention (cataract, iris rubeosis and rubeotic glaucoma, retinal detachment, increased inflammation and systemic side effects), quality of life measures performed at least six months following vitrectomy, and density of POVCH.	Two different researchers looked at all the studies we found and gathered the important information from them. We used the standard methods recommended by Cochrane, a group that specializes in evaluating medical research. We were mainly interested in how often people had bleeding in their eyes after surgery, both early and late. We also looked at how well people could see six months after surgery, how often they needed more surgery, and any side effects of the medicine. We also wanted to see how the medicine affected people's quality of life and how much bleeding there was.	This study looked at whether giving a medicine called anti-VEGF before surgery could help prevent a condition called POVCH. We wanted to see if this medicine helped prevent early and late POVCH. We also looked at other things like how well people could see six months after surgery, if they had a problem with their eyelids after six months, and if they had any side effects like cataracts, iris rubeosis, and rubeotic glaucoma. We also looked at how the medicine affected people's quality of life six months after surgery, and how much POVCH there was.
263	We used standard Cochrane methods for data collection and analysis. This included independent data extraction and'Risk of bias' assessment by at least two review authors per included study. We used the Haddon Matrix to categorise interventions aimed at the victim, the vector or the environment of the aggression and whether the intervention was applied before, during or after the event of aggression. We used the random-effects model for the meta-analysis and GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.	We used the standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration to collect and analyze our data. This involved two review authors independently reviewing each study and assessing its risk of bias. We used the Haddon Matrix to categorize the interventions based on whether they were aimed at the victim, the aggression itself, or the environment where the aggression happened. We also considered whether the intervention was meant to be used before, during, or after the aggression. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis and GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.	We used standard methods to collect and analyze the data from the studies we included. This included analyzing the data independently and assessing the risk of bias by at least two reviewers per study. We used the Haddon Matrix to categorize interventions aimed at the victim, the vector or the environment of the aggression, and whether the intervention was applied before, during, or after the event of aggression. We used the random-effects model for the meta-analysis and GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence.
264	We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Educational Resources Information Center, as well as COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease (indexing preprints) on 9 December 2020. We conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews.	We searched four major medical databases and two COVID-19 specific databases on December 9th, 2020, for research studies on this topic. We also looked at research papers that cited previous reviews on this topic.	We searched several medical databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Educational Resources Information Center, as well as COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease (indexing preprints) on December 9, 2020. We also looked backward-citation searches with existing reviews.
265	One review author extracted data, which another review author checked. The primary outcomes were loneliness and social isolation and the secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression and quality of life. One review author rated the certainty of evidence for the primary outcomes according to the GRADE approach and another review author checked the ratings. We conducted fixed-effect meta-analyses for the primary outcome, loneliness, and the secondary outcome, symptoms of depression.	One researcher collected the data from the studies, and another researcher checked the results. The main things we were looking at were loneliness and isolation, and we also looked at symptoms of depression and quality of life.  One researcher judged how certain we were about the evidence for loneliness and isolation using a system called the GRADE approach, and another researcher checked the results.  We then put all of the data for loneliness and depression together to see what the overall findings were.	This study looked at two main outcomes: loneliness and social isolation, and symptoms of depression and quality of life. One reviewer rated the certainty of the evidence for the main outcomes based on the GRADE approach, and another reviewer checked the ratings. The main outcome was loneliness and social isolation, and the secondary outcome was symptoms of depression and quality of life. One reviewer rated the certainty of the evidence for the primary outcomes based on the GRADE approach, and another reviewer checked the ratings. We conducted a fixed-effect meta-analysis for the primary outcome, loneliness, and the secondary outcome, symptoms of depression.
266	Two review authors independently screened search results and assessed full-text reports from among the potentially eligible trials. Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials and assessed the trial characteristics and risk of bias. The primary outcome was the risk of recurrence of pterygium at 3 months and 6 months after surgery. We combined results from individual studies in meta-analyses using random-effects models. Risk of recurrence of pterygium was reported using risk ratios to compare conjunctival autograft with amniotic membrane transplant.	Two experts in reviewing medical studies independently checked the search results and reviewed the full reports of the potentially eligible trials. Two other experts then independently collected data from the included trials and assessed the trial characteristics and potential biases. The main outcome we were interested in was the risk of the pterygium coming back after surgery at 3 months and 6 months. We combined the results of individual studies in a meta-analysis using random-effects models. The risk of recurrence of pterygium was reported using risk ratios to compare conjunctival autograft with amniotic membrane transplant.	This study looked at the risk of pterygium recurrence at 3 months and 6 months after surgery. The researchers combined the results of different studies using a statistical method called meta-analysis. They compared the risk of recurrence of pterygium recurrence using conjunctival autograft to amniotic membrane transplant.
267	Some antibody tests could be a useful diagnostic tool for those in whom molecular- or antigen-based tests have failed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including in those with ongoing symptoms of acute infection (from week three onwards) or those presenting with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. However, antibody tests have an increasing likelihood of detecting an immune response to infection as time since onset of infection progresses and have demonstrated adequate performance for detection of prior infection for sero-epidemiological purposes. The applicability of results for detection of vaccination-induced antibodies is uncertain.	Some antibody tests could be helpful for people who tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus using other methods, such as those who are still sick with COVID-19 after three weeks or those with long-term symptoms. These antibody tests are better at detecting an immune response as time passes since infection. They are also good for tracking how common COVID-19 is in a population. However, it is not clear how well these tests work for detecting antibodies produced after vaccination.	Some antibody tests could be helpful for people who haven't been able to detect the COVID-19 virus using molecular or antigen tests. This includes people who have been infected for a long time (from week three onwards) or those who have had COVID-19 afterward. However, antibody tests are becoming more likely to detect an immune response to infection as the infection progresses. They have shown good results for detecting previous infections for medical purposes. However, it's not clear if these results apply to people who have been infected with COVID-19.
268	Our primary objective was to assess the effects (benefits and harms) of ECT for people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Our secondary objectives were to determine whether ECT produces a differential response in people: who are treated with unilateral compared to bilateral ECT; who have had a long (more than 12 sessions) or a short course of ECT; who are given continuation or maintenance ECT; who are diagnosed with well-defined treatment-resistant schizophrenia as opposed to less rigorously defined treatment-resistant schizophrenia (who would be expected to have a greater affective component to their illness).	The main goal of this study was to look at the effects of ECT, both good and bad, for people with schizophrenia who don't get better with other treatments. We also wanted to see if ECT works differently depending on how it's given:  whether it's given to one side of the brain or both sides; whether people receive a short or long course of ECT; whether they receive ECT regularly after their initial treatment; and whether they have a specific type of schizophrenia that's more resistant to treatment.	This study aimed to understand the effects of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on people with schizophrenia that doesn't respond well to other treatments. The main goal was to see if ECT helps or hurts people with schizophrenia that doesn't respond well to other treatments. We also wanted to see if ECT makes a difference in people who are treated with unilateral versus bilateral ECT, who have had a long (more than 12 sessions) or a short course of ECT, who are given continuation or maintenance ECT, and who are diagnosed with well-defined treatment-resistant schizophrenia compared to less severe treatment-resistant schizophrenia (who would be expected to have a more affective component to their illness).
269	Surgery is a common treatment modality for stress urinary incontinence (SUI), usually offered to women for whom conservative treatments have failed. Midurethral tapes have superseded colposuspension because cure rates are comparable and recovery time is reduced. However, some women will not be cured after midurethral tape surgery. Currently, there is no consensus on how to manage the condition in these women. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013.	Surgery is a common way to treat stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which is a condition where urine leaks unintentionally, especially when coughing or sneezing. Usually, surgery is offered to women after other treatments have failed. A procedure called midurethral tape surgery has replaced an older procedure called colposuspension because it has similar success rates but takes less time to recover from.  However, some women still experience SUI after having midurethral tape surgery. There is no clear answer about what to do for these women. This information is an update of a previous review published in 2013.	Surgery is a common treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). It's usually given to women whose traditional treatments haven't worked. Midurethral tapes are a newer treatment that replaces colposuspension because they work just as well and take less time to recover. However, some women won't be cured after midurethral tape surgery. There's no agreement on how to manage this condition in these women. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2013.
270	We followed standard Cochrane methodology. Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. We assessed the following outcomes: treatment withdrawal; seizure-free at six months; adverse effects; and quality of life scoring. We conducted the primary analyses by intention-to-treat where possible, and presented a narrative analysis of the data.	We followed the usual steps used in Cochrane reviews. Two researchers independently picked the studies that met our criteria and gathered the important data from each study. We looked at how many people stopped treatment, how many were seizure-free after six months, and any side effects. We also looked at how the quality of life changed for people in the studies. Most of the analysis was done considering everyone who started the study, even if they dropped out, and we also wrote a summary of the findings.	We followed standard research methods used in Cochrane reviews. Two researchers independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted relevant data. We assessed the following outcomes: treatment withdrawal, seizure-free at six months, adverse effects, and quality of life scoring. We conducted the primary analyses by intention-to-treat where possible, and presented a narrative analysis of the data.
271	Seven studies involving 105 participants met the inclusion criteria of this review, six of which were cross-over in design. Six studies included adults with stable bronchiectasis; the other study examined clinically stable children with bronchiectasis. Three studies provided single treatment sessions, two lasted 15 to 21 days and two were longer-term studies. Interventions varied; some control groups received a sham intervention and others were inactive. The methodological quality of these studies was variable, with most studies failing to use concealed allocation for group assignment and with absence of blinding of participants and personnel for outcome measure assessment. Heterogeneity between studies precluded inclusion of these data in the meta-analysis; the review is therefore narrative. One study including 20 adults that compared an airway oscillatory device versus no treatment found no significant difference in the number of exacerbations at 12 weeks (low-quality evidence). Data were not available for assessment of the impact of ACTs on time to exacerbation, duration or incidence of hospitalisation or total number of hospitalised days. The same study reported clinically significant improvements in HRQoL on both disease-specific and cough-related measures. The median difference in the change in total St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score over three months in this study was 7.5 units (P value = 0.005 (Wilcoxon)). Treatment consisting of high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) or a mix of ACTs prescribed for 15 days significantly improved HRQoL when compared with no treatment (low-quality evidence). Two studies reported mean increases in sputum expectoration with airway oscillatory devices in the short term of 8.4 mL (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4 to 13.4 mL) and in the long term of 3 mL (P value = 0.02). HFCWO improved forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) by 156 mL and forced vital capacity (FVC) by 229.1 mL when applied for 15 days, but other types of ACTs showed no effect on dynamic lung volumes. Two studies reported a reduction in pulmonary hyperinflation among adults with non-positive expiratory pressure (PEP) ACTs (difference in functional residual capacity (FRC) of 19%, P value < 0.05; difference in total lung capacity (TLC) of 703 mL, P value = 0.02) and with airway oscillatory devices (difference in FRC of 30%, P value < 0.05) compared with no ACTs. Low-quality evidence suggests that ACTs (HFCWO, airway oscillatory devices or a mix of ACTs) reduce symptoms of breathlessness and cough and improve ease of sputum expectoration compared with no treatment (P value < 0.05). ACTs had no effect on gas exchange, and no studies reported effects of antibiotic usage. Among studies exploring airway oscillating devices, investigators reported no adverse events.	This review looked at seven studies involving 105 people with bronchiectasis, a lung condition that causes inflammation and scarring in the airways.  Most of the studies used a cross-over design, meaning participants received different treatments over time. The treatments studied included different types of airway clearance therapy (ACT), like high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) and airway oscillatory devices. Some participants received a fake treatment (sham) or no treatment at all.  The quality of the studies varied, with some not following the best practices for research. Overall, the results suggest that ACTs may help improve symptoms of bronchiectasis, such as shortness of breath, cough, and mucus production.  One study found that ACTs led to a significant improvement in quality of life for people with bronchiectasis. However, the evidence is not strong enough to say for sure that ACTs work better than no treatment. More research is needed to better understand the benefits and risks of ACTs for people with bronchiectasis.	This review looked at seven studies involving 105 people with bronchiectasis, a lung condition that affects the lungs. The studies included adults with stable bronchiectasis and children with stable bronchiectasis. The study found that using a special device called a high-frequency chest wall oscillator (HFCWO) or a combination of ACTs for 15 days significantly improved quality of life compared to no treatment. However, the quality of the evidence was low, so more research is needed to confirm these findings.
272	As the risk of adverse events, including mortality, may be increased by a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% or higher, and as robust evidence is lacking for a beneficial effect of a fraction of inspired oxygen of 60% or higher on surgical site infection, our overall results suggest that evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of a high fraction of inspired oxygen during anaesthesia and surgery. Given the risk of attrition and outcome reporting bias, as well as other weaknesses in the available evidence, further randomized clinical trials with low risk of bias in all bias domains, including a large sample size and long-term follow-up, are warranted.	Giving people very high levels of oxygen during surgery can be risky and might even increase the chance of them dying. There isn't enough evidence to say that giving high levels of oxygen helps prevent infections after surgery.  Therefore, we don't recommend routinely giving high levels of oxygen during surgery. We need more studies with fewer errors and more participants to be certain about the effects of high oxygen levels during surgery.	This study looked at whether using a higher amount of oxygen during anesthesia and surgery is a good idea. The study found that using a higher amount of oxygen may increase the risk of side effects, including death, and that there isn't enough strong evidence to say for sure if it helps prevent infection in the surgical site. The study also found that there isn't enough evidence to say whether using a higher amount of oxygen during anesthesia and surgery is a good idea. The study suggests that more research is needed to see if using a higher amount of oxygen during anesthesia and surgery is a good idea.

274	Determining the optimal method of performing second-trimester abortions is important, since they account for a disproportionate amount of abortion-related morbidity and mortality. To compare surgical and medical methods of inducing abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy with regard to efficacy, side effects, adverse events, and acceptability. We identified trials using Pub Med, EMBASE, POPLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). We also searched the reference lists of identified studies, relevant review articles, book chapters, and conference proceedings for additional, previously unidentified studies. We contacted experts in the field for information on other published or unpublished research. Randomised trials comparing any surgical to any medical method of inducing abortion at >= 13 weeks' gestation were included. We assessed the validity of each study using the methods suggested in the Cochrane Handbook. Investigators were contacted as needed to provide additional information regarding trial conduct or outcomes. Two reviewers abstracted the data. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous variables using RevMan 4.2. The trials did not have uniform interventions, therefore, we were unable to combine them into a meta-analysis. Two studies met criteria for this review. One compared dilation and evacuation (D&E) to intra-amniotic instillation of prostaglandin F2 a. The second study compared D&E to induction with mifepristone and misoprostol. Compared with prostaglandin instillation, the combined incidence of minor complications was lower with D&E (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.65) as was the total number of minor and major complications (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03-0.46). The number of women experiencing adverse events was also lower with D&E than with mifepristone and misoprostol (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.76). Although women treated with mifepristone and misoprostol reported significantly more pain than those undergoing D&E, efficacy and acceptability were the same in both groups. In both trials, fewer subjects randomised to D&E required overnight hospitalisation. Dilation and evacuation is superior to instillation of prostaglandin F2 a. The current evidence also appears to favour D&E over mifepristone and misoprostol, however larger randomised trials are needed.	This study looks at the best ways to end a pregnancy during the second trimester (between weeks 13-27).  It's important to find the safest and most effective methods because complications are more common in the second trimester. The study compared two main methods: surgical (like dilation and evacuation, or D&E) and medical (using drugs like prostaglandin or mifepristone and misoprostol). They searched for research studies and compared the results. They found that D&E generally had fewer side effects and complications compared to the other methods.  While some women using mifepristone and misoprostol had more pain, they found the drugs to be just as effective and acceptable as D&E. The study suggests that D&E might be better than using drugs, but more research is needed.	This study looked at two different ways to induce an abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy. The first method was called dilation and evacuation (D&E), which involves injecting a medicine called prostaglandin F2 a into the uterus. The second method was called induction with mifepristone and misoprostol. The study found that dilation and evacuation was better than mifepristone and misoprostol at preventing minor complications and reducing side effects. However, dilation and evacuation caused fewer side effects than mifepristone and misoprostol. The study also found that dilation and evacuation was better than mifepristone and misoprostol at preventing minor complications.
275	It is difficult to determine to what extent the findings from the meta-analysis can be applied to clinical practice. Given the considerable variability of specificity values and lack of defined thresholds for determination of test positivity in the included studies, the current evidence does not support the routine use of 18F-FDG PET scans in clinical practice in people with MCI. The 18F-FDG PET scan is a high-cost investigation, and it is therefore important to clearly demonstrate its accuracy and to standardise the process of 18F-FDG PET diagnostic modality prior to its being widely used. Future studies with more uniform approaches to thresholds, analysis and study conduct may provide a more homogeneous estimate than the one available from the included studies we have identified.	While the results of this study are interesting, it is difficult to say how they can be applied to everyday medical care.  The studies included in the meta-analysis had a lot of variation in how they measured the accuracy of the scan, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions.  Because of this, the study does not recommend that this scan be routinely used in patients with MCI.  The scan is also expensive, so it is important to make sure it is accurate and used consistently before it becomes widely used.  More research is needed that uses consistent methods to measure the accuracy of the scan.	This study looked at how well 18F-FDG PET scans can be used to diagnose people with multiple sclerosis (MCI). The study found that the 18F-FDG PET scan is a very expensive test, so it's important to make sure it's accurate and that it's done in a way that's easy to understand before it's widely used. Future studies with more consistent methods might provide a more accurate estimate than what we found in the studies we looked at.
276	1. Primary objective The primary objective was to determine whether using non-benzodiazepine GABA agonist drugs for at least six weeks was clinically effective for the treatment of antipsychotic-induced TD in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or other chronic mental illnesses. 2. Secondary objectives The secondary objectives were as follows. To examine whether any improvement occurred with short periods of intervention (less than six weeks) and, if this did occur, whether this effect was maintained at longer periods of follow-up. To examine whether there was a differential effect between the various compounds. To test the hypothesis that GABA agonist drugs are most effective for a younger age group (less than 40 years old).	Our main goal was to find out whether using a type of medicine called non-benzodiazepine GABA agonist drugs for at least six weeks could help people with mental illnesses like schizophrenia recover from a condition called tardive dyskinesia (TD). TD is a movement disorder that can happen as a side effect of some mental health medications. We also wanted to learn more about:  Whether shorter periods of treatment (less than six weeks) could help, and if so, whether the improvement would last. If different types of these medicines worked better for some people than others. If these medicines worked better for younger people (under 40 years old). 	This study aimed to see if using non-benzodiazepine GABA agonist drugs for at least six weeks was effective in treating TD in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or other chronic mental illnesses. The main goal was to see if short periods of treatment (less than six weeks) were effective and if this improvement continued for longer periods of follow-up. We also wanted to see if there was a difference in the effects between the different medications. We also wanted to test the hypothesis that GABA agonist drugs are most effective for younger people (less than 40 years old).
277	We included both parallel-group and cluster-randomised controlled trials (C-RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort studies, controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series studies of UCT interventions in children (0 to 17 years) and adults (>= 18 years) in LMICs. Comparison groups received either no UCT, a smaller UCT or a CCT. Our primary outcomes were any health services use or health outcome.	This study looked at different ways to give money to people in poor countries and see if it helps their health. They looked at studies that gave money without any conditions (UCTs) or only gave money if people did certain things (CCTs). They also looked at studies where people got no money, less money, or got money only if they did something. They wanted to see if getting money affected how often people used healthcare services or their overall health.	We looked at studies that compared different ways to improve health services for children and adults in low- and middle-income countries. We included both parallel-group and cluster-randomised controlled trials (C-RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort studies, controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series studies of UCT interventions in children (0 to 17 years old) and adults (>= 18 years old) in these countries. We compared groups that received no UCT, a smaller UCT, or a CCT. Our main outcomes were whether UCT interventions affected the use of healthcare services or health outcomes.
278	Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted data. Results were reported as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes the mean difference (MD) was used or standardised mean difference (SMD) if different scales had been used. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model. Subgroup analysis and univariate meta-regression were performed to investigate between study differences. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.	"This study was reviewed by two different experts to make sure it was done correctly and to find any possible problems. They looked at the results of the study and reported them in a way that's easy to understand. For things that could be either yes or no, they used something called a ""risk ratio"" with a ""confidence interval"" to show how sure they were about the results. For things that were measured on a scale, they used a ""mean difference"" or a ""standardized mean difference"" to compare the results. They also did some extra calculations to see if there were any differences between the different parts of the study. Finally, they used a system called ""GRADE"" to rate how much confidence they had in the results."	Two different people looked at the studies to see if they met our criteria, if they had any problems with how they were done, and if they collected information from them. We reported the results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for outcomes that were either positive or negative. For outcomes that were positive or negative, we used the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) if we used different scales. We performed statistical analyses using the random-effects model. Subgroup analysis and univariate meta-regression were done to investigate differences between the studies. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.
279	We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in'Additional tables'.	We reviewed studies about different treatments for children with asthma attacks. We searched a database of research summaries called the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We also looked at research that wasn't included in those summaries but might be helpful. We checked the quality of the included studies using a tool called ROBIS criteria. We then summarized the information from the studies and created a map showing the different clinical trials that were done. The main things we looked at were how long kids stayed in the hospital, whether they needed to be admitted to the hospital or intensive care, and if they had any side effects. We put all the details in the main text and included extra information in tables.	We looked at studies that tested different treatments for children with asthma attacks. We searched for studies published up to December 28, 2019. We also found studies that might be eligible for, but weren't currently included in, published studies.

281	Cerebral palsy (CP) is a heterogeneous group of non-progressive disorders of posture or movement, caused by a lesion of the developing brain. Osteoporosis is common in children with cerebral palsy, particularly in children with reduced gross motor function, and leads to an increased risk of fractures. Gross motor function in children with CP can be categorised using a tool called the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Bisphosphonate increases bone mineral density (BMD) and reduces fracture rates. Bisphosphonate is used widely in the treatment of adult osteoporosis. However, the use of bisphosphonate in children with CP remains controversial, due to a paucity of evidence and a lack of recent trials examining the efficacy and safety of bisphosphonate use in this population.	Cerebral palsy (CP) is a condition that affects movement and posture. It's caused by damage to the brain during development. Many children with CP have weak bones, which makes them more likely to break bones. This is especially true for children who have trouble moving around. We can measure how well children with CP can move using a system called the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). A medicine called bisphosphonate can make bones stronger and reduce the risk of fractures. It's commonly used to treat weak bones in adults. However, we're not sure if it's safe and effective for children with CP. We need more studies to find out.	Cerebral palsy (CP) is a condition where the brain doesn't develop properly. It causes problems with posture and movement, especially in children with cerebral palsy. Osteoporosis is a common problem in children with CP, especially when they can't move as much. This can lead to fractures. A tool called the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) can help categorize gross motor function in children with CP. Bisphosphonate is a substance that increases bone mineral density and reduces the risk of fractures. Bisphosphonate is used widely for treating adult osteoporosis. However, the use of bisphosphonate in children with CP remains controversial due to a lack of evidence and a lack of recent studies examining the effectiveness and safety of bisphosphonate in this population.
282	Breast-conserving therapy for women with breast cancer consists of local excision of the tumour (achieving clear margins) followed by radiotherapy (RT). RT is given to sterilize tumour cells that may remain after surgery to decrease the risk of local tumour recurrence. Most true recurrences occur in the same quadrant as the original tumour. Whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) may not protect against the development of a new primary cancer developing in other quadrants of the breast. In this Cochrane review, we investigated the delivery of radiation to a limited volume of the breast around the tumour bed (partial breast irradiation (PBI)) sometimes with a shortened treatment duration (accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI)).	When women have breast cancer, one treatment option is to remove the tumor surgically while making sure there are no cancer cells left in the surrounding area.  This is followed by radiation therapy to kill any remaining cancer cells and lower the chances of the cancer returning in the same spot.  Most times, if the cancer comes back, it's in the same part of the breast where the tumor was originally.  Giving radiation to the whole breast may not prevent new cancers from forming in other parts of the breast.  This study looked at giving radiation to a smaller area around the tumor (partial breast irradiation) sometimes using a shorter treatment schedule (accelerated partial breast irradiation).

284	We included randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating enteral lactoferrin (at any dose or duration), used as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy, compared with antibiotic therapy alone (with or without placebo) or other adjuncts to antibiotic therapy to treat neonates at any gestational age up to 44 weeks' postmenstrual age with confirmed or suspected sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell's Stage II or III).	This study looked at whether giving lactoferrin along with antibiotics helped babies with sepsis (a serious blood infection) or necrotizing enterocolitis (a serious bowel disease). The study only included babies who were born prematurely or had a high risk of these conditions. Lactoferrin was compared to antibiotics alone, or antibiotics with a placebo (a fake treatment), or other treatments that help with these conditions.	We looked at studies that compared lactoferrin, a medicine used to treat sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell's Stage II or III), to antibiotics alone (with or without a placebo) or other treatments. These studies included babies born up to 44 weeks after menstruation who had either confirmed or suspected sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell's Stage II or III).
285	In total, we extracted data from 54 studies. Overall, 19 (20%) studies reported adequate random sequence generation and allocation concealment and adequately accounted for incomplete outcome data; we considered these studies to have an overall low risk of bias. Studies were largely free from selection bias, but research results may be vulnerable to performance and detection bias, as only four of the RCTs reported blinding of participants to treatment allocation, and, although most RCTs reported blinded outcome assessment, pain, physical function and quality of life were participant self-reported. High-quality evidence from 44 trials (3537 participants) indicates that exercise reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.39 to -0.59) immediately after treatment. Pain was estimated at 44 points on a 0 to 100-point scale (0 indicated no pain) in the control group; exercise reduced pain by an equivalent of 12 points (95% CI 10 to 15 points). Moderate-quality evidence from 44 trials (3913 participants) showed that exercise improved physical function (SMD -0.52, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.64) immediately after treatment. Physical function was estimated at 38 points on a 0 to 100-point scale (0 indicated no loss of physical function) in the control group; exercise improved physical function by an equivalent of 10 points (95% CI 8 to 13 points). High-quality evidence from 13 studies (1073 participants) revealed that exercise improved quality of life (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.40) immediately after treatment. Quality of life was estimated at 43 points on a 0 to 100-point scale (100 indicated best quality of life) in the control group; exercise improved quality of life by an equivalent of 4 points (95% CI 2 to 5 points). High-quality evidence from 45 studies (4607 participants) showed a comparable likelihood of withdrawal from exercise allocation (event rate 14%) compared with the control group (event rate 15%), and this difference was not significant: odds ratio (OR) 0.93 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.15). Eight studies reported adverse events, all of which were related to increased knee or low back pain attributed to the exercise intervention provided. No study reported a serious adverse event. In addition, 12 included studies provided two to six-month post-treatment sustainability data on 1468 participants for knee pain and on 1279 (10 studies) participants for physical function. These studies indicated sustainability of treatment effect for pain (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.14), with an equivalent reduction of 6 (3 to 9) points on 0 to 100-point scale, and of physical function (SMD -0.15 95% CI -0.26 to -0.04), with an equivalent improvement of 3 (1 to 5) points on 0 to 100-point scale. Marked variability was noted across included studies among participants recruited, symptom duration, exercise interventions assessed and important aspects of study methodology. Individually delivered programmes tended to result in greater reductions in pain and improvements in physical function, compared to class-based exercise programmes or home-based programmes; however between-study heterogeneity was marked within the individually provided treatment delivery subgroup.	This study looked at 54 different research papers about exercise and its effects on pain, physical function, and quality of life for people with knee pain.  Overall, the study found that exercise is a good way to reduce pain, improve physical function, and enhance quality of life.  The study also found that exercise is generally safe, with only a few minor side effects reported, such as increased pain in the knee or lower back. The study showed that exercise can improve these things both immediately after treatment and for months after treatment. However, the study also found that there was a lot of variation in how the studies were conducted, and this made it difficult to compare the results across all of the studies.	This study looked at 54 different research projects that tested the effects of exercise on people with knee or lower back pain. The researchers found that exercise helped reduce pain, improve physical function, and improve quality of life. However, there were some side effects, like increased knee or lower back pain. The study also found that exercise did not significantly improve quality of life. The researchers suggest that more research is needed to understand the long-term effects of exercise on people with knee or lower back pain.
286	Four trials fulfilled the selection criteria: one of azathioprine (27 participants), two of IFN beta-1a (77 participants in total) and one of methotrexate (60 participants). The risk of bias was considered low in the trials of IFN beta-1a and methotrexate but high in the trial of azathioprine. None of the trials showed significant benefit in any of the outcomes selected by their authors. The results of the outcomes which approximated most closely to the primary outcome for this review were as follows. In the azathioprine trial there was a median improvement in the Neuropathy Impairment Scale (scale range 0 to 280) after nine months of 29 points (range 49 points worse to 84 points better) in the azathioprine and prednisone treated participants compared with 30 points worse (range 20 points worse to 104 points better) in the prednisone alone group. There were no reports of adverse events. In a cross-over trial of IFN beta-1a with 20 participants, the treatment periods were 12 weeks. The median improvement in the Guy's Neurological Disability Scale (range 1 to 10) was 0.5 grades (interquartile range (IQR) 1.8 grades better to zero grade change) in the IFN beta-1a treatment period and 0.5 grades (IQR 1.8 grades better to 1.0 grade worse) in the placebo treatment period. There were no serious adverse events in either treatment period. In a parallel group trial of IFN beta-1a with 67 participants, none of the outcomes for this review was available. The trial design involved withdrawal from ongoing IVIg treatment. The primary outcome used by the trial authors was total IVIg dose administered from week 16 to week 32 in the placebo group compared with the IFN beta-1a groups. This was slightly but not significantly lower in the combined IFN beta-1a groups (1.20 g/kg) compared with the placebo group (1.34 g/kg, P = 0.75). There were four participants in the IFN beta-1a group and none in the placebo group with one or more serious adverse events, risk ratio (RR) 4.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 80.05). The methotrexate trial had a similar design involving withdrawal from ongoing corticosteroid or IVIg treatment. At the end of the trial (approximately 40 weeks) there was no significant difference in the change in the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale, a disability scale (scale range 0 to 12), the median change being 0 (IQR -1 to 0) in the methotrexate group and 0 (IQR -0.75 to 0) in the placebo group. These changes in disability might have been confounded by the reduction in corticosteroid or IVIg dose required by the protocol. There were three participants in the methotrexate group and one in the placebo with one or more serious adverse events, RR 3.56 (95% CI 0.39 to 32.23).	This study looked at four different treatments for a medical condition. Two of the treatments were IFN beta-1a, one was azathioprine, and one was methotrexate. The study found that the two treatments with IFN beta-1a had a low risk of causing problems, while the azathioprine treatment had a high risk of problems. However, none of the treatments showed any clear improvement in the patients' condition. The azathioprine treatment seemed to help a little, but not enough to be sure. The IFN beta-1a treatment didn't show any clear improvement, and one of the trials using this treatment had some serious side effects. The methotrexate treatment also didn't show any clear improvement, and there were some serious side effects.	This study looked at four different treatments for a condition called Neuropathy Impairment. These treatments include azathioprine, IFN beta-1a, and methotrexate. The study found that azathioprine and methotrexate were better than prednisone at improving neuropathy symptoms after nine months. However, azathioprine and methotrexate were not better than methotrexate at improving neuropathy symptoms. The study also found that azathioprine and methotrexate were better than methotrexate at improving neuropathy symptoms. The study also found that methotrexate was better than methotrexate at improving neuropathy symptoms. The study also found that methotrexate was better than methotrexate at improving neuropathy symptoms. The study also found that methotrexate was better than azathioprine at improving neuropathy symptoms. The study also found that methotrexate was better than methotrexate at improving neuropathy symptoms.
287	We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this review. We assessed methodological limitations using a list of predefined criteria. We extracted and assessed data regarding study authors' motivations for carrying out their study. We used a thematic synthesis approach to analyse and synthesise the evidence.

288	We included women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment, meaning both in vitro fertilisation and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, with a history of subfertility and with subclinical hypothyroidism or with euthyroid ATD. We excluded women with a previously known clinical hypothyroidism or already taking thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine. RCTs compared thyroxine (levothyroxine) with either placebo or no treatment.	We included women who were having fertility treatments, like in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and had a history of having trouble getting pregnant. These women also had either subclinical hypothyroidism (a mild thyroid problem) or euthyroid autoimmune thyroid disease (a thyroid problem where the thyroid is working normally but the immune system attacks it).  We did not include women who already had a known thyroid problem, were already taking thyroid medicine, or were taking a different thyroid medicine called tri-iodothyronine. We looked at studies that compared thyroxine (levothyroxine) to either a placebo or no treatment.	We looked at studies that compared thyroxine (levothyroxine) to either a placebo (a fake treatment) or no treatment at all.

289	Cancer-related fatigue is reported as the most common and distressing symptom experienced by patients with cancer. It can exacerbate the experience of other symptoms, negatively affect mood, interfere with the ability to carry out everyday activities, and negatively impact on quality of life. Educational interventions may help people to manage this fatigue or to cope with this symptom, and reduce its overall burden. Despite the importance of education for managing cancer-related fatigue there are currently no systematic reviews examining this approach.	Cancer-related fatigue is a very common and upsetting symptom that many cancer patients experience. It can make other symptoms worse, make people feel sad, stop them from doing everyday activities, and affect their quality of life.  Learning how to manage this fatigue or cope with it could help reduce its impact.  Even though it's important to learn how to manage cancer-related fatigue, there aren't any systematic reviews that have looked at how education can help.

290	Based on high-quality evidence this review confirms that paracetamol provides only minimal improvements in pain and function for people with hip or knee osteoarthritis, with no increased risk of adverse events overall. Subgroup analysis indicates that the effects on pain and function do not differ according to the dose of paracetamol. Due to the small number of events, we are less certain if paracetamol use increases the risk of serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and rate of abnormal liver function tests. Current clinical guidelines consistently recommend paracetamol as the first-line analgesic medication for hip or knee osteoarthritis, given its low absolute frequency of substantive harm. However, our results call for reconsideration of these recommendations.	This study looked at whether paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) helps people with hip or knee osteoarthritis. The study found that paracetamol only slightly reduces pain and improves function, but there is no increased risk of side effects. However, the study wasn't able to definitively say if paracetamol increases the risk of serious side effects, such as needing to stop taking the medication or having abnormal liver function. Despite these findings, current guidelines recommend paracetamol as the first choice for pain relief in osteoarthritis. However, our study results suggest that these recommendations may need to be reconsidered.	This review of high-quality evidence shows that paracetamol does not significantly improve pain and function in people with hip or knee osteoarthritis, with no increased risk of side effects overall. The effects of paracetamol on pain and function do not vary depending on the dose of paracetamol. However, due to the small number of side effects, we are less certain if paracetamol use increases the risk of serious side effects, withdrawals due to side effects, and abnormal liver function tests. Current guidelines recommend paracetamol as the first-line analgesic medication for hip or knee osteoarthritis, given its low absolute frequency of substantive harm. However, our findings call for reconsideration of these recommendations.
291	All-cause death is similar for first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs, thiazides and beta-blockers. There are, however, differences for some morbidity outcomes. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. First-line CCBs increased HF but decreased stroke compared to first-line RAS inhibitors. The magnitude of the increase in HF exceeded the decrease in stroke. Low-quality evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors reduced stroke and total CV events compared to first-line beta-blockers. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.	The study found that people who take RAS inhibitors as their first choice for blood pressure medicine have a similar risk of death compared to people who take other types of blood pressure medicine. However, there are some differences in how these medicines affect other health problems.  For example, people taking thiazides (another type of blood pressure medicine) had fewer heart failures and strokes than people taking RAS inhibitors.  People taking calcium channel blockers (another type of blood pressure medicine) had more heart failures but fewer strokes than people taking RAS inhibitors.  It seems that the increase in heart failures was greater than the decrease in strokes.  There is not enough evidence to say for sure, but RAS inhibitors may be better than beta-blockers (another type of blood pressure medicine) at preventing strokes and heart problems.  Interestingly, the differences in how well these medicines lower blood pressure did not explain the differences in health problems.	This study looked at the effects of different types of blood pressure medications, including first-line RAS inhibitors, CCBs, thiazides, and beta-blockers. The results showed that all-cause death was the same for all causes. However, there were differences in some outcomes. First-line thiazides caused less heart failure and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. First-line CCBs increased heart failure but decreased stroke compared to first-line RAS inhibitors. The magnitude of the increase in heart failure exceeded the decrease in stroke. Low-quality evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors reduced stroke and total heart events compared to first-line beta-blockers. The small differences in blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.

294	Ovulatory disturbance is a key diagnostic feature of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), leading to infertility and correspondingly heavy disease burden. Many therapeutic strategies have been used to induce ovulation for women with PCOS who are infertile. Ultrasound-guided transvaginal ovarian needle drilling (UTND) is a novel surgical method used to induce ovulation for women with clomiphene-resistant PCOS at the outpatient clinic.	Having irregular ovulation is a key sign of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which can lead to infertility and significant health problems.

295	We identified 18 RCTs examining a range of complex interventions for people with multimorbidity. Nine studies focused on defined comorbid conditions with an emphasis on depression, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The remaining studies focused on multimorbidity, generally in older people. In 12 studies, the predominant intervention element was a change to the organisation of care delivery, usually through case management or enhanced multidisciplinary team work. In six studies, the interventions were predominantly patient-oriented, for example, educational or self-management support-type interventions delivered directly to participants. Overall our confidence in the results regarding the effectiveness of interventions ranged from low to high certainty. There was little or no difference in clinical outcomes (based on moderate certainty evidence). Mental health outcomes improved (based on high certainty evidence) and there were modest reductions in mean depression scores for the comorbidity studies that targeted participants with depression (standardized mean difference (SMD) -2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.52 to -1.95). There was probably a small improvement in patient-reported outcomes (moderate certainty evidence) although two studies that specifically targeted functional difficulties in participants had positive effects on functional outcomes with one of these studies also reporting a reduction in mortality at four year follow-up (Int 6%, Con 13%, absolute difference 7%). The intervention may make little or no difference to health service use (low certainty evidence), may slightly improve medication adherence (low certainty evidence), probably slightly improves patient-related health behaviours (moderate certainty evidence), and probably improves provider behaviour in terms of prescribing behaviour and quality of care (moderate certainty evidence). Cost data were limited.	This study looked at 18 different ways to help people with multiple health problems. Nine of these focused on specific health problems like depression, diabetes, and heart disease, while the rest were for older people with many health problems. Most of these methods involved changing how care was delivered, like having a single person coordinate care or having a team of doctors work together. A few methods focused on helping patients themselves, like giving them information or teaching them how to manage their conditions. The study found that these methods had mixed results. Some showed improvement in mental health, while others had no clear effect on overall health. There was some evidence that these methods may help patients manage their conditions better and make it easier for doctors to prescribe the right treatments.	We looked at 18 studies that tested different ways to help people with multiple health problems, like depression, diabetes, and heart disease. These studies mainly focused on older people. Most of the studies focused on people with multiple health problems, like depression, diabetes, and heart disease. Most of the studies focused on people with multiple health problems, like depression, diabetes, and heart disease. Most of the studies focused on people with multiple health problems, like depression, diabetes, and heart disease. Most of the studies focused on changing how healthcare is delivered, usually through case management or teamwork. In some studies, the interventions were mostly focused on helping people manage their health, like education or self-management support. Overall, we found that there was little to no difference in how well people were able to manage their health. However, there was a small improvement in mental health outcomes and depression scores for people with depression. However, two studies specifically focused on functional difficulties had positive effects on functional outcomes, with one study reporting a reduction in death at four years. The interventions may slightly improve medication adherence, patient-related health behaviors, and provider behavior in terms of prescribing behavior and quality of care. We didn't have enough information about the cost of the interventions.

297	"To assess the efficacy and safety of re-feeding compared to discarding gastric residuals in preterm infants. The allocation should have been started in the first week of life and should have been continued at least until the baby reached full enteral feeds. The investigator could have chosen to discard the gastric residual in the re-feeding group, if the gastric residual quality was not satisfactory. However, the criteria for discarding gastric residual should have been predefined.

This study aims to compare the effects of re-feeding leftover milk to premature babies versus throwing it away, to see if it's safer and more effective. The study should start in the first week of life and continue until the baby is fully fed by mouth. Researchers could choose to discard the leftover milk if it wasn't good quality, but they should decide on the criteria for discarding the milk beforehand. The study should also look at different factors, such as the baby's gestational age, birth weight, type of milk, quality of the leftover milk, and how much milk is replaced.
